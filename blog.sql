Working as a designer in the fast-paced and stress inducing fashion industry, the long days, late nights and crazy deadlines started to take their toll. Anxiety was becoming the norm and as such my sleep started to suffer. So much for that laid-back Cali lifestyle!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a friend who first suggested I try CBD to help with anxiety and sleep. I’ve never really been into cannabis having found it doesn’t really agree with me, so I was hesitant at first. However, after researching it and hearing from other friends and colleagues about how it had helped them, I decided to give it a go. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within just a few days of trying CBD I felt my anxiety levels improve. The dread I felt on my morning commute disappeared, deadlines became more manageable and I was able to focus more at work and ultimately, feel more present, I actually started to love my work again, My passion for fashion was reignited and it was down to the therapeutic effects of CBD. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, my husband, James, set up one of California’s first legal cannabis dispensaries, so CBD was part of our professional lives as well as our personal. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>In 2016, we had our first child, Leo, and decided to move back to the UK to be closer to family (aka the free babysitters). Upon our return I was really excited to see that CBD was now available in the UK too. However, I was disappointed by the products on offer. Not only did most of the contain really low levels of CBD that would be ineffective, I also found dropping the oil tinctures under my tongue to be an unpleasant experience. On top of that, a lot of products were confusing and difficult to navigate, basing dosage on countless variables such as a person’s weight, diet, metabolism and environment. I was buying CBD to help with stress...not cause it! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognising a gap in the market for high strength, enjoyable CBD products, we created OTO. Together with a group of friends that includes world leading scientists, entrepreneurs and anthropologists, we set out to create the world’s finest CBD experiences. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have now created a unique range of effective products that enhance daily rituals to help you find your space. Each oil is designed to complement the natural rhythm of your day with three pillars: focus, amplify and balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through our unique curation and creation process (OTOSYNTHESIS), we source the highest quality essential oils, scents and flavours from around the world, blending them with pure CBD. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each product comes with the OTO Strength guarantee, ensuring the optimum levels of CBD to enhance your natural wellbeing and reduce anxiety.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>To discover the power of CBD and OTO’s range of optimum strength products <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/collections.html\">click here</a>.</p>','2019-05-23 07:57:34','2020-10-23 14:13:16','2019-05-23 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/gemma-colao-oto-1080.jpg','Gemma Colao OTO',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'GfkBfLilCvlNemkqaxqzzz9Ia878RSOv',0,NULL,'Gemma Colao, founder of OTO,  describes her journey of discovery',0),(4,'Can CBD oils help with anxiety?

Scientists, pharmaceutical professionals and mental health experts are getting more than a little excited by this molecule, and it’s remarkable effects; specifically when it comes to dealing with anxiety, the defining sociological condition that our society faces today.</p>\r\n<p>Anxiety is the most common mental health issue here in the UK with twice as many women affected than men. We will all feel anxious at some point. It’s a completely natural reaction to danger or stress; however, increasingly people are experiencing a more constant feeling of anxiety that is out of proportion to the situation. </p>\r\n<p>Anxiety can affect your mood and self-confidence, but most concerning, is that it can lead to deliberating panic attacks and anxiety-related illnesses. In fact, in 2013 there were <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23884863\">8.2 million cases</a> of anxiety and the number is believed to be rising.</p>\r\n<p style=\"display:none\">The notion that CBD can be used to alleviate anxiety is becoming more and more popular. Our own extensive consumer trials showed that 86% of participants who suffered from anxiety registered an improvement after regular use of our high strength CBD oils, while 83% said that daily use of OTO has helped them control their worrying. </p>\r\n<p>So how does CBD help anxiety? <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923339\">Preliminary research</a> suggests that CBD helps the body process serotonin, the chemical that contributes to happiness and wellbeing. Key medicinal minds, including Dr Esther Blessing, an assistant professor at New York University of Medicine, call CBD \"the most promising drug that has come out for neuropyschiatric diseases in the last 50 years\". </p>\r\n<p style=\"display:none\">As well as containing 20% CBD from organic sources, OTO’s products contain ayurvedic botanicals that complement the wellness benefits of CBD. For example our <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/balance-20-percent-cbd-essential-oil.html\">Balance roll on oil</a> contains lavender, which is renowned for its calming properties and cajeput, which can help relieve feelings of restlessness. </p>\r\n\r\n{{widget type=\"Magento\\Cms\\Block\\Widget\\Block\" anchor_text=\"\" title=\"\" template=\"widget/static_block/default.phtml\" page_id=\"\" block_id=\"13\" type_name=\"CMS Static Block\"}}','2019-05-23 07:59:06','2020-05-27 15:41:18','2019-05-23 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/anxiety-cbd-blog.jpg',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'MTDDpkr97mCKPeqNj2Ivx7hHBGmzNIxn',0,NULL,'We look at some of the latest research surrounding CBD and anxiety...',0),(5,'Can CBD oils help with bad sleep?',NULL,NULL,'Many people have bad sleep.

According to a 2017 Sleep Council study of over 5,000 people , 35% of us have experienced sleeping problems for more than five years - that’s over a third of us regularly having a bad night’s sleep; while 74% said they sleep for less than the recommended 7 hours a night. </p>\r\n<p>The impact of this lack of sleep is huge; affecting your energy, productivity and overall mood.  In fact it’s such a problem, that in 2017 World Health Organisation declared a ‘sleep loss epidemic’ in developed nations.</p>\r\n<p>Anecdotally, Hemp, the mother plant of CBD, has been used as a sleep aid for centuries. Gretchen Lidicker, author of CBD Oil: Everyday Secrets: A Lifestyle Guide to Hemp-Derived Health and Wellness, said that sleep was positively impacted by CBD due to its anti-anxiety properties and the ability to promote relaxation. </p>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n<p>CBD is able to interact with serotonin receptors, which play an important role in boosting mood and calming anxiety. CBD also interacts with GABA receptors, which are the main ‘inhibitory’ neurotransmitters in the brain, calming excess activity in the brain and promoting relaxation. </p>\r\n<p>It is even thought to help with chronic insomnia more than the typically prescribed melatonin. While melatonin directly signals to the body that it’s time to go to sleep by raising the naturally occurring levels of melatonin in the body, it doesn’t help with the underlying anxiety that causes insomnia in the first place. </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\"><img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://otocbd.com/pub/media/full-moon-501.jpg\" alt=\"full moon\"></div></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"display:none\">At OTO, we developed our Balance pillar to help with sleep and our extensive consumer trials showed that 83% of trialists who had significant issues sleeping reported an improvement when regularly applying OTO.</p>\r\n<p>There are no sure-fire ways to get to sleep, but the NHS suggest a regular night time routine as one of the keys to getting a good sleep; a quiet mind, relaxed body and calm bedroom. With this in mind, to create our Balance oil, we combine the purest, vegan-friendly CBD extracted from organically grown-hemp plants with a carefully curated trio of essential oils, each of which are also regarded for their ability to improve sleep; lavender, chamomile and cajeput.</p>\r\n<p>Lavender, of course, is known for its soothing reputation. Nature’s seditative, it increases slow-wave sleep which is the very deep slumber in which the heartbeat slows and muscles relax. During this phase, the brain is thought to organise memory, as well.</p>\r\n<p>Chamomile is another popular pre-bedtime oil. It is in fact a very mild natural tranquilizer, containing an antioxidant called apigenin which induces sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Cajeput is less well known in the West, but is popular in South East Asia. It is a multitude of benefits including alleviating restlessness which is ideal for a good night’s sleep.</p>\r\n<p>For a deep and reinvigorating slumber, ritually apply <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/balance-20-percent-cbd-essential-oil.html\">OTO CBD Balance</a> to either your temples or wrists. </p>\r\n<p>And watch out for the much-anticipated  <span class=\"strong\">OTO CBD Pillow Mist</span> , which will be launching very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n','2019-05-23 08:14:49','2020-11-08 08:24:27','2019-05-23 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/woman-sleep-in-ferns-1080.jpg',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'ZmAYlqn9AUBpa6o5iA1VYBu1qcTxJPXP',0,NULL,'Many of us have sleep problems.

There are so many distractions in modern society: in the home, at work, on the move; that it can often be difficult to concentrate on the task-in-hand. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s no wonder that recent research has found that two thirds of Brits feel a constant sense of dread caused by the stress of their day-to-day lives; mounting work pressures, busy social calendars and financial worries.  Your ability to focus can have a significant impact on your quality of life, creating an endless sense of being overwhelmed, and this was why we developed our Focus CBD Oil. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBD is a natural molecule that is produced in the human body to regulate amonst other things, brain function.  <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436124/\">Preliminary resarch </a>suggests that taking CBD could improve  cognitive behaviour, reduce hyperactivity and help concentration.

However, endo-cannabinoids are the very same natural compound, but produced internally by our bodies. Historically, plants have always given us an incredible insight into the human physiology. Studying how plants interact with our bodies has allowed the discovery of the body’s native opioid receptors which help regulate pain and stress response  (from poppy flowers and opium), our nicotinic receptors which influence neuronal excitement (through the study of tobacco and nicotine) and now our endo-cannabanoid receptors and the endocannabinoid system. </p> \r\n\r\n<h3>What is the Endo-Cannabanoid System (ECS)?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECS is a system of receptors in the human body that interact exclusively with cannabanoids. In 1980, a scientist at St Louis University Medical School was studying cannabinoids and where they ended up in the brain, discovering CB1 receptors, which were later found in the kidneys, lungs and liver as well. A different type of cannabinoid receptor, CB2 was then found in white blood cells, the gut, reproductive tract and the spleen;  since the 1980s, it has now been confirmed that CB2 receptors can be found in every major system within the body. </p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://otocbd.com/pub/media/endocannabinoid-system_copy.jpg\" alt=\"endocannabinoid system\" />\r\n\r\n<p>These cannabinoid receptors sit on the surface of cells and “listen” to conditions outside the cell, transmitting information about changing conditions to the inside of the cell, which in turn, kick-starts the appropriate response - basically helping the body to maintain its equilibrium, known biologically as homeostasis (the proven hypothesis that biological systems are actively regulated by hormones and molecular systems to maintain ‘just right’ conditions). This physiological system regulation is considered especially crucial to a returning a human’s body to its natural state after it has been disturbed, for example; native cannabinoids, or endocannabinoids, increase after injury in order to resolve inflammation and other damage signals. They also increase after strenuous exercise (and are also considered by some scientists to be the science behind ‘runners high’ rather than the more commonly known endorphins, as well as binding with serotonin receptors (boosting the body’s “feel good” molecular system) and stimulating GABA receptors (responsible for calming the nervous system). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, CBD is generally considered to return your body to it’s natural, just right state. However, it is produced by the body on demand, not stored or constant - so if you supplement your body with additional CBD through <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/collections.html\">oils</a> and <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/bitters.html\">bitters</a> , you may be able to  ensure that your body feels it is at it’s ‘just right’ level, all the time. </p>\r\n','2019-06-19 16:32:28','2020-05-27 15:43:25','2019-06-19 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/endocannabinoid-cover.jpg',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,'Why makes CBD tick?

It\'s elusive, right? Some would say downright tricky. It conjures up mental images of toned women in all-white workout gear, smiling benignly at bowls of un-dressed salad. In reality it might be simply finding more time to create, or chilling out once a week by yourself, or putting your phone down an hour before bed. With </span><a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/statistics/mental-health-statistics-stress\"><strong>74% of us in the UK saying we feel overwhelmed or unable to cope</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there\'s a real need to not only find balance, but to hold onto it and build it into our every day.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, that starts at home. Home is our resting place, our recharging station and the hub around which life is lived - when our homes are balanced, our lives feel more balanced too. My own journeys on Instagram </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thecrapflat/\"><strong>@thecrapflat</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and through my blog, </span><a href=\"https://allupinmyspace.com/\"><strong>All Up In My Space</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have made me think about the spaces we create in new ways, especially looking at how we can use them to sustain better mental health. So, without further ado, here\'s my guide to decorating your way to relaxation and balance, one carefully-placed throw pillow at a time.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Define your happy</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes your heart sing? For me, it\'s clean lines and neutral tones in a colour palette of anaemic toast (mmm, toast), but maybe for you it\'s inky blues and evocative art? Maybe you yearn to wake up in a room that feels cosy; maybe space is your thing; maybe you want one of those under-floor fish tanks with a trapdoor like Bond villains have. Whatever it is that gets your calm going, it\'s worth taking time to find it. Hit up Pinterest and Instagram, flip through interiors magazines and - most importantly - shop your own home, taking note of the things you already own that give your heart a little flutter of, \'Thank flipping goodness I got/kept/stole that\'. It\'s so easy to get sucked into trends and newness, but a space that\'s all yours should start with a deep, emotional understanding of what you truly like.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxtpU3onfJM/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

If you had to, could you confidently explain what mood you want to evoke for your living room? Truth be told, you\'ll probably never have to do either of those things, but my point is about knowing your needs and taste, and stepping into those before you make a purchase. Enter the moodboard. I\'m a lazy moodboarder, so I screengrab and bung things into Powerpoint, but if you\'re so inclined you can collect fabrics and images and textures and tones and have a ripe old time getting creative.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Lay it out</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create the most beautiful, zen-like space inside, but if you wake up facing a window that looks into somebody else\'s bathroom, you\'re never going to feel the benefit, so consider this with your layout. I spent many years waking up to dressing gowns hung on the back of a bedroom door, and can vouch for the negative effect it had on my day. Same goes for furniture placement – nothing\'s guaranteed to dent your Qi quite like not being able to move freely around your space. Notice how you naturally move through it and then make the space work around that. And if you have to wake up looking at the back of a door? Make that door the best door you\'ve ever seen.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Tone up</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not in the workout sense – I\'m talking colour. We established long ago that I get my calm kicks from warm neutrals and toast – where do you get yours? I can\'t imagine feeling calm in a room painted neon, but maybe you can..? There\'s no judgement here. Painting a room can feel like a big decision, so if you\'re not totally sure what chills you out, close your eyes and think of the last time you were really relaxed – where was it? Can you take any tonal inspiration from there? Once you have a vague idea, explore that colour palette, grab some swatches and see which ones speak to you. Maybe you carry one palette through each floor of the house to help with flow, maybe you switch it up completely from room to room – if it works for you, I\'m here for it.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Texture</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Existing, as I do, on a plane of beige and white, texture is important. It helps to stop a space looking stark, and creates a sense of warmth. Layers invite you to snuggle up, fabrics soften hard edges and wood grain brings in a touch of nature. Even within those parameters there are decisions to be made. Do you prefer a raw linen or a silky satin? Do you fold your throws or artfully cast them askew? I favour a relaxed look and feel that doesn\'t make me want to tidy it up every ten seconds. Consider multiple blankets and soft, squashy pillows; play with one colour over several textures – there\'s a big game being played in textural, plaster-like wall paint right now too. Find what you love and go hell for full-grain leather.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Make shapes</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what? Circles calm me. Straight lines calm me. In fact, anything minimal and un-fussy calms me. So I carry those shapes through my whole space. You\'ll find circle prints in the bedroom that mirror a round table in the living room – it\'s about creating a sense of continuity through shapes. That cohesion helps your brain to recognise its surroundings, meaning it doesn\'t need to look for threats and can therefore stay calm. Sounds a little meta, but I swear there\'s truth in it.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Love your stuff</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose wisely, move slowly – that\'s my motto. From the furniture to the rug to the print on the wall, everything needs to give you an emotional or functional benefit to warrant its place in your space. And if it gives you both, all the better. As an habitual impulse-buyer I\'m learning to see something I love and wait to buy it. If I\'m still thinking about it a week or two after I\'ve seen it, I know it\'s the one. Shopping this way means I\'m taking more time to think about where I\'m buying and who I\'m buying from, meaning I really appreciate the stories and craft that go into certain pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxc_rWUnyNT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Which connects in no way to my point on plants, which is: fill your space with plants. If you can look after them and keep them alive, they\'ll clean your air and make things look nice. Heck, they\'ll even lower your </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419447/#!po=1.31579\"><strong>blood pressure</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><br><strong>Smell the goodness</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My flat has an unusual smell, gifted to us by years of blocked drains and a small but persistent damp problem. For this reason, and because I have a serious home fragrance habit, my place is loaded with candles and oils and diffusers, usually with a relaxing scent profile. Choose natural fragrances with no nasties in them, to keep your air as non-toxic as possible – a plant-based soy candle or paraben-free spray should do the job. I\'m also a big smell-fan of the </span><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/balance-20-percent-cbd-essential-oil.html\"><strong>OTO Balance Oil</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is blended with calming lavender, chamomile and cajeput. And a </span><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/oto-cbd-pillow-mist.html\"><strong>pillow mist</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the ultimate pre-bed ritual, too – if you get into a spritzy routine, your brain starts to associate the scent with sleep and it will help you drift off better (that is if you\'re still awake once the 30% CBD takes effect).&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Make time</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The absolute most crucial part to creating a sense of balance at home? Make time for yourself in it.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since launching my blog and Instagram this year, my life has become a whirlwind of deadlines and phone-time and meetings and events and last-minute changes and all the things that balance-professionals would say balance isn\'t. So when I\'m at home I make sure I find the time for breaks and breathers. 20 minutes for a steaming bath here, a quick roll-on of my OTO oil there – finding balance in my space has been as much about taking myself and my wellbeing seriously as it\'s been about finding nice things. Try lighting a candle at the end of your working day, then once that becomes a normal thing to do, try taking five minutes to do some </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByPggaJBKJC/\"><strong>breathwork</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Before you know it you\'ll be stepping off the tube and straight into calmsville.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><strong>In conclusion…</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes your relaxing space is totally unique to you, and finding out what that is can be an empowering part of the journey to a balanced life. There\'s power in getting to know what you love and why you love it, and a huge sense of relaxed achievement to be found in looking around at the space you\'ve created that\'s your little part of the world. Take your time, trust your gut and stay well clear of anything that looks like an un-dressed salad.&nbsp;</span></p>','2019-09-12 09:34:05','2020-05-27 15:43:58','2019-09-12 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/Screenshot_2019-09-12_at_10.38.26.png',NULL,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'TDOjTLyDZqPn19jUIU5XPqxPvjO3tTDw',0,NULL,'Emma from the award-winning interiors website  All Up In My Space talks us through creating a mindful, balanced home',0),(9,'How to sleep better - trying CBD oils and other tips for a good night\'s rest','CBD Oils for Sleep',NULL,'OTO\'s team of scientists give us their five top tips to help you get a good night\'s rest.','five-tips-for-better-sleep',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>It wasn’t until I became a mum that I realised how much I took a good night’s sleep for granted. With a two year old and a new business to run, sleep has become the new luxury in my life. Forget Champagne and macaroons… pass me the eye mask!</p>\r\n<p>However, it isn’t just becoming a parent that can result in sleep issues. Stress, work and even heat waves means that, according to the <a href=\"https://sleepcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/The-Great-British-Bedtime-Report-2017-1.pdf\">2018 Sleep Council </a>survey, 74% of us aren’t getting the recommended minimum of seven hours sleep a night.</p>\r\n<p>A good night’s sleep is just as important as exercise and a healthy diet and clocking in eight hours or more on a nightly basis can help improve memory, reduce stress and allows the body and mind to heal. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130723155002.htm\">recent clinical trial</a>by Estée Lauder also found that people who regularly sleep less showed increased signs of skin ageing (and we all saw the photos of J-Lo’s 50th birthday celebrations and she swears by eight to ten hour’s sleep every night!).</p>\r\n<p>I want everyone to get a good night\'s rest so I asked OTO scientists, Dr Ketan Joshi and Dr Michael Haslam to share their five top tips to help you sleep better.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>The power of CBD and sleep</strong></h2>\r\n<p>By promoting homeostatis i.e. balancing the body, CBD can help to regulate your internal sleep / wake cycle, ultimately making it easier to fall asleep at night and also wake up in the morning.</p>\r\n<p>Our own consumer trials showed extremely positive results in regards to regularly taking CBD and improved sleep. In the trials for our new <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/oto-cbd-pillow-mist.html\">OTO Pillow Mist</a>, 87% of participants reported an improvement in sleep quality, with 92% also benefiting from improved mood, energy and concentration. If you prefer, you could try cbd oil for sleep like <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/oto-sleep-drops.html?\">OTO Sleep Drops</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Create a regular bedtime routine</strong></h2>\r\n<p>In today’s hectic modern world, this is perhaps easier said than done. However, creating a regular schedule for bed will programme the brain and sleep cycle into a set routine. Your internal body clock is the greatest sleep aid and it can take between three to ten days to reset. The trick is to stick to this routine even at weekends for consistency.</p>\r\n<p>Develop a pre-bedtime routine that will help you to wind down and detach yourself from the events of the day. It is important that your mindset is focussed towards sleep, so turn off your phone and try to forget about any worries that will keep your mind ticking over into the night. The hour leading up to sleep should be your moment of calm, so focus on whatever helps you to relax, whether that be practising gentle yoga, a bath or meditation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Hang up the phone</strong></h2>\r\n<p>We all know the impact ‘blue light’ has on sleep, the hard part is switching off. For my fellow ‘nomophobics’ (aka a fear of being without a mobile phone), there are a few handy tips to break the addiction. First, switch your phone to ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode at least an hour before bed. This will stop any notifications or calls coming through, allowing you to slowly disengage from the outside world. This can be automatically scheduled on most phones. There is also a wonderful new feature on most new phones called ‘Downtime\', which allows you to turn off access to your apps during set hours, which is perfect for breaking that pre-bedtime Instagram habit.</p>\r\n<p>Another handy tip is to automatically set a ‘night shift’ on your phone which automatically adjusts your screen from blue light to the warmer end of the spectrum which is less stimulating and easier on your eyes. If you still can’t resist the urge to reach for your phone, tuck it away at the opposite side of the room out of arm’s reach.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Comfort is key</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Investing in a good quality bed, mattress and bedding can do wonders for a good night’s sleep. Of the three, investing in a mattress is the most essential. A bad mattress won’t just affect your sleep, it can also result in back and joint pain.</p>\r\n<p>A mattress isn\'t necessarily something you associate with craftsmanship, but a lot of skill goes into making premium mattresses and the difference is noticeable. A good quality mattress can come with a hefty price tag, but when your spending a third of your life in bed it makes total sense to have the best.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Optimise your bedroom environment</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Noise and light pollution can both affect sleep, as can temperature; so creating a pleasant space can help you drift into a relaxing slumber.</p>\r\n<p>Make sure the room is cool. It is said to be between 16-18°C is the optimum temperature for sleep. Again this is where CBD can help as it helps the body remain calm and balanced, naturally assisting with symptoms of overheating.</p>\r\n<p>Blackout curtains are a light sleepers best friend and make sure all light emitting electronics are switched off (think stand-by buttons, electric clocks). Noise is a little bit more tricky - especially if you live by a main road - however, many friends report on the benefits of using a white noise machine. They work by generating high-pitched static, or white noise, that consists of randomized frequencies to aid sleep. Not just for adults, you can also find models designed for children and even babies and can also be a useful study/concentration aid.</p>','2019-09-12 09:37:14','2020-11-08 08:22:49','2019-09-16 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/750299329_Pillow_Spray_01_AW_27.11.18_copy.jpg',NULL,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'qhEWFpq9H3PAz2hC40ylKWAWNZnLaR5Y',0,NULL,'<p>OTO\'s team of scientists give us their five top tips to help you get a good night\'s rest.</p>',0),(10,'Giving is the new black',NULL,NULL,NULL,'giving-is-the-new-black',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>There’s a general consensus that Black Friday marks the start of the Christmas period, a time of giving, joy & celebration, but also sadly for some a time of sadness, anxiety and suffering. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this year, instead of participating in Black Friday, we’ve chosen to honour the season of giving and pay it forward with Give Back Friday.

Amplifying the social experience, drinks made with OTO’s non-alcoholic bitters will use the power of CBD to help attendees relax, and connect. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guests will be welcomed to the hedonistic hideaway of Blakes Below and begin their evening with an introduction to OTO CBD and a CBD shot, delivering optimum levels of CBD and blended with a composition of natural botanical extracts and purified water, the perfect remedy to FOCUS, AMPLIFY or BALANCE. They will then be led into a 60-minute high intensity breath work session, led by Breathpod Founder Stuart Sandeman (as featured in the likes of The Times, GQ, Women’s Health). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set to a special soundtrack of mind-expanding and highly vibrational sounds to deepen and elevate the experience, the coaching will encourage participants to let go of their negative habits, stresses and anxieties, and move into a higher state of learning, development, self-awareness, growth and flow. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the session, the Blakes Below feel-good cocktails will be served, whilst guests are invited to share in their experience and enjoy the opulent surrounds of the Oriental-inspired subterranean late-night lounge, as the DJ starts to spin into the night. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tickets: £35 per person and include one OTO Ready-to-Drink CBD shot, a 60-minute Breath session and a CBD cocktail. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>BOOK BELOW </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>7pm, Friday 17th January -<a href=\"https://otherness.co/events/breathing-room-at-blakes-london-with-breathpod-and-oto-cbd/\"> Book Now</a></p>\r\n<p>7pm, Friday 24th January -<a href=\"https://otherness.co/events/breathing-room-at-blakes-london-with-breathpod-and-oto-cbd-2/\"> Book Now</a></p>\r\n<p>7pm, Friday 31st January - <a href=\"https://otherness.co/events/breathing-room-at-blakes-london-with-breathpod-and-oto-cbd-2/\"> Book Now</a></P>\r\n','2020-01-13 14:23:42','2020-09-22 15:23:19','2020-01-13 00:00:00',0,1,0,'magefan_blog/breath-pod.jpg','OTO Breath Session',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'JeG2n692yVkBRlcHoLChPY0JyJoz6fcg',0,NULL,'Join us for a relaxing CBD Breath Session at the Blakes Hotel, South Kensington',NULL),(16,'CBD 101 - A beginners guide to Cannabidiol','CBD 101 a beginners guide to Cannabidiol',NULL,'A quick beginners guide telling you what  CBD is,  what are its benefits, how much to take  and  whether it\'s safe.','cbd-101-a-beginners-guide-to-cannabidiol',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<h3>What is CBD?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p> CBD stands for Cannabidiol and is a completely natural, compound derived from the hemp plant that has been declared safe by the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/CannabidiolCriticalReview.pdf\">World Health Organisation</a>. It will not get you high and in fact our bodies already produce a very similar substance to CBD on its own, known as Endogenous Cannabinoids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more on \'what is  CBD’\' <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/journal/post/what-is-cbd\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How does CBD react with the human body? </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All cannabinoids, whether produced by the body or extracted from the hemp plant, react with a complex network of cannabinoid receptors found in the body, known as the <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Human Endocannabinoid System (HES)</span>. The HES is responsible for creating homeostasis - or balance - within the body, as well as regulating physiological functions such as: aiding pain management and reducing inflammation; encouraging healthy sleeping patterns; positively influencing mood; and reducing stress and anxiety - to name just a few. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human Endogenous Cannabinoids are produced by our body on demand and are not stored or constant. Often levels can deplete and as such our sleep may suffer or we may feel higher levels of anxiety or pain. By supplementing our natural Endogenous Cannabinoids with plant-based CBD, it can help restore homeostasis within the body. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more about the HES <a href=\"https://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/CannabidiolCriticalReview.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the benefits of CBD?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are only just beginning to untap the potential of this incredible molecule, but research and anecdotal evidence is revealing how CBD may help with <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-017-0775-9\">sleep</a>, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-015-0387-1\">stress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19839936\">mood</a> and certain <a href=\"https://www.jci.org/articles/view/64628\">skin conditions</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24117398\">\"pain management</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19199042\">inflammation</a>. </p>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<p>There are so many ways that CBD is transforming people’s lives and everyday we hear incredible stories from our customers on how our products may have helped them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more on the power of CBD <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/discover-the-power-of-cbd.html\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;happy-lady.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"The benefits of CBD\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>How much CBD should you take?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Through extensive research, our team of world-leading scientists determined the optimum daily dose of CBD to between 40 - 60mg to help benefit from its potential. This figure is also supported by other leading experts within the field of CBD. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of our products are designed to deliver this amount of CBD per day - which is also referred to as our <b>OTOStrength</b> guarantee. When shopping for CBD products, make sure you opt for high-strength products that are easy to dose. There are too many products on the market that contain ineffective levels of CBD and therefore you are unlikely to experience any of the benefits. OTO gives you peace of mind that all of our products deliver the recommended daily amounts of 40-60mg in an enjoyable and effective way.

The fast-paced and deadline driven nature of the job led to sleepless nights and high-levels of anxiety. My health, career and relationships were all suffering until a friend suggested I try CBD. Initially I balked at the suggestion! Having tried (and failed) to smoke Cannabis as a student it didn’t sound like something for me, but my colleague persuaded me that CBD is completely different to a joint and I soon started experiencing the benefits of this incredible ingredient. My sleep and anxiety improved dramatically and I even noticed that my hormonal acne was better. I was hooked and it was from here that the journey towards creating OTO was born. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon my return to the UK, I was disappointed by the products on offer. Not only did most contain really low levels of CBD that would be ineffective, I also found dropping the oil tinctures under my tongue to be an unpleasant experience. On top of that, a lot of products were confusing and difficult to navigate. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with a group of friends that includes world leading scientists, entrepreneurs and anthropologists, we set out to create the world’s finest CBD experiences and thus... OTO was born. We initially launched in May 2019 with a trio of 20% CBD roll-on oils that are applied to pulse points and the CBD is absorbed transdermally through the skin. Each of the oils falls under one of our three pillars (as all of our products do). Focus - which is our daytime pillar; Amplify - perfect for social moments and Balance - which is designed for your pre-bedtime ritual. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of our products come with the <b>OTOStrength</b> guarantee, so you can be assured that you are receiving the optimum amount of CBD per day. All of our products feature high-quality, ayurvedic botanicals to enhance the benefits of the CBD and are made in the UK, are cruelty free and vegan. However, most importantly, what makes OTO unique is that OTO works. From improved sleep to reduced anxiety and better skin, our products have transformed so many people’s lives over the past 12 months and we look forward to helping more people throughout 2020 and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>','2020-01-14 16:08:57','2020-01-16 15:15:39','2020-01-14 00:00:00',0,1,0,'magefan_blog/balance-1080.jpg','What is CBD',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yt6vABUpXR0DxbvlQrZRrMfoXRZvu3qf',0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17,'International Women\'s Day - The Importance Of Role Models',NULL,NULL,'Ahead of our International Women’s Day event we chatted to Little Pink Book’s founder Roberta Hickey, on her opinion of role models, why they’re so important ','international-womens-day-the-importance-of-female-role-models',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,' <p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Ahead of our International Women’s Day event we chatted to Little Pink Book’s founder Roberta Hickey, on her opinion of role models, why they’re so important and how the definition of a role model changes as you get older (and why hers is no longer Faye from Steps!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked to write this blog I began by looking up the definition of a role model. I noticed that in many of the descriptions it referred to a role model as someone looked up to by children or younger people and I couldn’t help thinking I don’t think that is necessarily the case. I certainly had role models when I was younger but they are very different to what they are today, back then I would say my role models were Faye from Steps or Rachel from S Club 7 (mainly due to how well she wore bandana tops). Now in my 30s (eeps) I think that role models are more important to me than ever, they certainly come in all different forms and not always people who are older or more senior career wise. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <div class=\"row\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-5 img-centred-box\" style=\"min-height:300px;\">\r\n        \r\n            <img src=\"https://otocbd.com/pub/media/roberta-hickey-new.jpg\" alt=\"Roberta Hickey\" style=\"padding:5px 5px 15px 15px\" />\r\n\r\n \r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"col-lg-7\">\r\n\r\n<p>In a society where the role and positioning of women has changed dramatically in my parents life time and certainly my grandparents I think it’s imperative for women of all ages to have positive role models. Using the music industry as an example, as that is the focus of little pink book, despite a move forward there is still a long way to go to reach equality within the industry. I believe the way we will achieve this is by shining a light on brilliant women working in music to showcase the different roles in the industry and break stereotypes associated with them. In areas such as sound engineering, tour managing and production (to name a few) I believe female role models are so important to encourage other women to consider those roles themselves and follow in their footsteps.</p>\r\n           \r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n <p>Discussing the importance of female role models I feel it is necessary to mention social media and how this can build idols that become unhealthy for young women to be striving towards. A platform built on likes and filters is creating goals which are unattainable as these people don’t exist in that form in the real world. There is a real responsibilty that comes with being a role model and I do believe people are waking up to this and using social media platforms to speak about real life issues like mental health and every day struggles. I believe the best role model is not necessarily someone with a perfect glossy life but how someone deals with ups and downs like everyone else and is open about that</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve noticed how role models change depending on where you are in life, speaking to a friend recently she said as she is considering having a baby soon, her role models are working mum’s as she is in awe of how they juggle everything. I found that interesting in thinking about role models as when initially considering their importance I immediately associated them with been inspiring and a way to help motivation, which they certainly are. However, I also think a level of their importance comes from the fact that they can bring reassurance and a role model can be someone who you admire purely for the way they handle everyday life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">By Roberta Hickey</p>\r\n<p>Roberta is a freelance music consultant who specialises in talent representation, brand partnerships & events.

And if the constant stream of headlines is making you feel overwhelmed, you’re not alone. Most of us are feeling increased levels of stress, whether it’s triggered by concern for the vulnerable people in your life or worries about money or job security - there’s a lot to take in and process.</p>\r\n<p>Rituals naturally help reduce anxiety and stress because they focus on what is familiar and don’t take much conscious thinking. We thought we’d share some of the small daily rituals that the OTO team use to help calm their minds. Try adding one, two or all to your morning routine.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><h2>Breathing Exercises</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Conscious breathing has a calming effect on our nervous system. A simple and effective breathing technique that is helpful for calming symptoms of stress &amp; anxiety is the 4-7-8 breathing exercise. Dr. Weil, who has developed this technique, describes it as “a natural tranquilizer for the nervous system”.</p>\r\n<p>4 -  start by breathing deeply right into your stomach while you count to four</p>\r\n<p>7  - hold your breath while you count to seven </p>\r\n<p>8  - breathe out audibly for eight </p>\r\n<p>Repeat this cycle four times.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><h2>Count Your Blessings</h2>\r\n<p>One of the unfortunate ways anxiety and stress work is that it shifts our focus on to the negative. Instead of seeing things as they really are, we pick out the negative details about our life and dwell on them.</p>\r\n<p>That’s why a powerful morning ritual is to do the exact opposite - remind yourself of something that’s good in your life. </p>\r\n<p>Maybe it’s thinking about the last time you belly-laughed with your best friend, or how you have a warm &amp; comfortable bed to rest in, or a particular piece of clothing that makes you happy - channel Marie Kondo and think of anything that sparks joy. </p>\r\n<p>In the OTO office, we like to concentrate our minds by combining this positivity moment with the physical motion of  <a href=\"/shop/cbd-roll-ons.html\">rolling our oils</a> onto our temples and wrists.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><h2>Do A Small Workout</h2>\r\n<p>Physical activity of any kind is an effective treatment for anxiety or stress - a number of studies have shown how daily exercise can be as powerful, or in some cases even more powerful, than common anxiety medication.</p>\r\n<p>It not only helps the mind process and deal with thoughts and worries, it can physically help the body recover from the feelings that come with stress &amp; anxiety as well. And let’s not forget your post-exercise endorphin release!</p>\r\n<p>Find something active that doesn’t take up too much of your time to focus on when you first wake up. Whether it’s a brief workout from YouTube, an outdoor run or a short yoga flow - exercise reduces stress hormones and releases neurotransmitters into the brain that help us relax.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n<li><h2>Quietly Drink A Hot Drink</h2>\r\n<p>Rituals naturally help reduce anxiety and stress because they focus on what is familiar and don’t take much conscious thinking. </p>\r\n<p>Choosing to make a hot drink and taking our time to drink it peacefully is a quick and easy ritual to add to your daily routine. The added bonus is that if you choose to go drink a herbal tea, many have calming effects as they contain the anxiety-reducing amino acid L-Theanine which gives us that welcome warming sensation when we sit down to drink.</p>\r\n<p>To further amplify your calming moment &amp; feel the power of CBD at a time when you need it most, you could even add a few drops of our <a href=\"/oto-cbd-bitters.html\">OTO CBD Bitters</a> to your hot drink..</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<img src=\"https://otocbd.com/pub/media/breathing-ecercises.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"landscape loading\" data-was-processed=\"true\">\r\n<li><h2>Communicate</h2>\r\n<p>We’ve all heard the adage, a problem shared is a problem halved - and there’s a definite point to it!</p>\r\n<p>We’re all in the same boat and talking to a loved one about how you’re feeling may help waylay any feelings of anxiety, stress or impending doom. </p>\r\n<p>Many of us think that when it comes to sharing our problems and worries, we don’t want to be a bother - however it’s time to turn this opinion on its head. Chances are if someone you loved was struggling internally, you would want them to come to you.  </p>\r\n<p>Find someone you trust and share your thoughts - you might find a weight lifts instantly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<ol>\r\n','2020-03-20 04:39:31','2020-08-04 13:58:48','2020-03-20 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/5-tips-anxiety3.jpg','Five tips on reducing stress',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Jkp7G4EbQYtFSPoeG0OQbjwzLj260273',0,NULL,'These are extremely stressful times and if you’re feeling overwhelmed, you’re not alone.

Sound is a very important part of OTO & how we help others discover the power of CBD. We work closely with sound therapist, Michelle Cade from Mind Like Water Wellbeing so we thought we’d have a chat with her about the powerful combination of sound & CBD and how we can use sound to amplify the effect of CBD on our health and wellbeing.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all know a hot bath is a relaxing and nourishing experience on its own, however, adding essential oils, Epsom salts and candles can amplify the therapeutic effect, taking your bath to a whole new level of relaxation - that ́s how I see the benefits of adding CBD into the sound healing mix.  </p>\r\n<p>Both sound and CBD work to bring the body back into balance, triggering its healing response. Our incredible and intelligent bodies naturally want to repair themselves and are always prioritising bodily tasks for the sake of healing, if given the optimal conditions.  </p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://otocbd.com/pub/media/gong-bath-3.jpg\" alt=\"Gong Bath CBD\" />\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:2rem\">How Does Sound Healing Work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything has a sound and its own unique vibration, even if we can’t hear it. The frequency at which something naturally vibrates is called resonance, and each part of our body has its own unique resonance. \r\nVibrational medicine is based on the idea that disease is a result of those natural resonances becoming out of tune – whether due to stress, illness or environmental factors, trauma etc.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound and music have the power to instantly change your state of being – physically, emotionally and mentally. If you listen to one of your favourite high energy songs just before doing some exercise or during, you’ll instantly feel more energised, or if you listen to a particularly sad song when you’re at a low ebb, your emotions will feel amplified. Music can unlock memories, be used to create new ones and heighten learning. Listening to Binaural beats, which is two beats one after the other that slightly differ in frequency and makes use of the fact that the right and left ear each receive a slightly different frequency tone, yet the brain perceives these as a single tone, can help create whole brain synchronization, which makes it easier to focus and take in new information.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The body is almost a giant sound conductor: skin, bones, ears, as well as the water that makes up around 70% of the adult body, all pick up & conduct sound waves, so it is logical that both audible and inaudible vibrations would have a profound effect on us. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">“If we accept that sound is vibration and we know that vibration touches every part of our physical being, then we understand that sound is heard not only through our ears but through every cell in our bodies. One reason sound heals on a physical level is because it so deeply touches and transforms us on the emotional and spiritual planes. Sound can redress imbalances on every level of physiologic functioning and can play a positive role in the treatment of virtually any medical disorder.” <br>\r\n - Dr. Mitchell Gaynor, director of Medical Oncology and Integrative Medicine, the Cornell Cancer Prevention Center in New York. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound can help you to relax deeply, restoring harmony and bringing balance to the body’s biological rhythms and processes. It can also re-establish correct functioning of the Endocrine system (the glands), helping to release powerful healing and feel good hormones such as endorphins, oxytocin and serotonin. It also helps to lower Cortisol (stress hormone) levels. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://otocbd.com/pub/media/gong-bath-4.jpg\" alt=\"Gong bath\" />\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:2rem\">What is Sympathetic Resonance?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When exposed to external overtones/sounds, your brain waves start to slow down and synchronise, due to something called Sympathetic Resonance. This is when one vibrating object causes another to vibrate in harmony with it or match its rate of vibration. Sympathetic resonance can also induce a meditative state helping to calm busy, anxious minds & the stressed shut down for brief respites. Dr Bruce Lipton explains how sound can change physiological processes.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Receptor antennas can also read vibrational energy fields such as light, sound, and radio frequencies. The antennas on these energy receptors vibrate like tuning forks. If an energy vibration in the environment resonates with a receptor’s antenna, it will alter the proteins charge, causing the receptor to change shape. Because these receptors can read energy fields, the notion that only physical molecules can impact cell physiology is outmoded. Biological behaviour can be controlled by invisible forces as well as it can be controlled by physical molecules like penicillin, a fact that provides the scientific underpinning for pharmaceutical free energy medicine.”  <br>\r\n- Bruce Lipton  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The sympatico between sound therapy & CBD is too great to ignore – and is an extremely powerful tool when used in tandem – keep an eye out for our next CBD Soundbath so you can feel the power for yourself. </p>\r\n \r\n<img src=\"https://otocbd.com/pub/media/michelle-gong-bath-2.jpg\" alt=\"CBD and Sound Therapy\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Here are my top ways to incorporate sound into your daily life to tackle stress and anxiety: </h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Music </span><br>\r\nTaking time out to listen to your favourite song and just listen, dance or sing along. Give it your full attention - it can transform your mood. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Binaural Beats</span><br>\r\nBinaural Beats can help create whole brain synchronisation which makes it easier to focus and take in new information or enter meditative states. You can listen to my Binaural\' beats here: <a href=\"https://www.mindlikewatermusic.bandcamp.com\">www.mindlikewatermusic.bandcamp.com</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Vocal Toning and Chanting</span><br>\r\nThis can even mean singing your favourite song or free styling and being silly. We sing when we are happy so we can influence & change our moods. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Humming</span><br>\r\nTake a moment to breath and hum to connect and centre yourself. Some people find it helps to calm them down, slows down your breathing rate which helps to manage stress levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sound Journeys and Gong Baths</span><br>\r\n<p>One of the best ways to  experience sound healing is on one of our virtual sound meditations.

Enough was enough; the negatives far outweighed the positives, and the occasional wild, frivolous night was definitely not worth the hangover (or the dehydrated skin and sluggishness that would last for the ensuing week).</p>\r\n \r\n<p>At the beginning, it was difficult to break the habit because it was so firmly woven into my social life. I felt like alcohol helped me to connect with people and break down barriers, as if I were my more chatty ‘best’ self when I’d had a drink to lower my inhibitions. But I quickly realised I was wrong, that it may have numbed the part of my brain that cared about what people thought and, in the process, was acting as a barrier to connecting properly with them - and with myself. During my first period off the booze, I made a concerted effort to chat with others, while sober, and realised my interactions quickly became easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"d-md-none d-lg-none d-xl-none comp-push\">\r\n<div style=\"margin:2rem;border:1px black solid;padding:1.5rem;text-align:center\">\r\n<h1> Join us for a virtual sound meditation</h1>\r\n<p>This Sunday, join us for a relaxing and meditative virtual sound bath with renowned practitioner Mind Like Water Wellbeing. </P>\r\n<a href=\"https://otocbd.com/journal/post/virtual-oto-sound-medication?fys\" class=\"btn btn-dark btn-large\" style=\"background-color:#BE84A3;color:white;border:none;padding: 5px 25px;font-size: 16px;\">Sign Up for Free</a>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n \r\n<p>However, there is only so many virgin mojitos and green teas a person can consume, and I still craved a fast relaxation fix so I started to dabble with CBD and, after some trials and error, have discovered a perfect post-office tipple for when I want to socialise, celebrate, date or simply relax.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>After a few, I find myself mellowed, but with clarity (and without a hideous hangover the next day).

It’s something that affects millions of us, yet it remains a rarely talked about aspect of mental health - now more than ever. \r\nWe are delighted to announce that we have partnered with actress, Cressida Bonas, on her new podcast, Fear Itself, which explores this very subject and how it can impact our lives: how does fear show up, how do people try to hide it, how can we harness it and what can we learn from it?</p>\r\n<p> In these extraordinary times, the subject of fear has sadly never been more relevant, and we hope you will find the podcast both inspirational and perhaps even a welcome distraction during the difficult times. \r\nFeaturing an array of guests including Ellie Goulding, Freddie Fox and Elizabeth Day, Fear Itself explores our relationship with fear and at a time when many people are, fearing for themselves, their neighbours and loved ones, as well as the impact this will have on our world, it is a curious topic.</p>\r\n<p>Although a rarely talked about aspect of mental health, fear can be crippling and CBD can help us with our management of our own fear, by calming the mind, attenuating anxiety and promoting a healthy stress response. There has even been a study, conducted by JAMA Psychiatry in 2009 that showed that CBD lowered our physical responses fear, rather than just a subjective feeling of calm.</p>\r\n<p>Fear Itself features conversations between Cressida and a variety of guests from lots of different walks of life, discussing their relationship to fear throughout their lives. In her experience, fear can be motivational, but can also hold us back and she was curious to understand dynamic a bit better. </p>\r\n<p>In light of current news, she says that making this podcast reinforced for her that although fear can be overwhelming and panic-inducing, it can also be a force for good, and a weapon to fight this crisis - it makes us take precautions and follow expert advice, but, in particular it can drive us to adapt and work together to help each other during what seems like an impossibly challenging time.</p>\r\n<p>Podcasts can be a great way of connecting people by hearing other people’s stories and thoughts, making people feel less alone especially at unknown times like these and we hope that this podcast can give small moments of distraction, entertainment and respite from the news.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/show/1AQoUgky6EBDJPYQEuH9Pt\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>','2020-03-20 05:13:29','2021-04-01 11:47:01','2020-03-20 00:00:00',0,1,21,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'RDH7PcooawfC6d63YXAETY4SSBSrqMaX',0,NULL,'Cressida Bonas\' Fear Itself podcast about fear and how to manage it',NULL),(22,'Don\'t Miss The Drug Store x OTO CBD Sound Journey',NULL,NULL,NULL,'dont-miss-the-drug-store-x-otocbd-sound-journey',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>Many of us are experiencing heightened stress and anxiety - some of us for the first time having not previously been impacted - during the Covid-19 crisis and it is incredibly important to practice self-care and take a moment for yourself during these difficult times.

As we’ve <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/journal/post/the-powerful-combination-of-sound-and-cbd\">discussed before</a>, sound & CBD work hand in hand, as both promote a healing reaction in the body, and the use of binaural beats is one of the most common. We spoke to Michelle about what binaural beats are, and how can we use them to change our state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Binaural means ‘having or relating to two ears’ and the concept of binaural beats is simple. It means hearing two tones, of slightly different frequencies, sent simultaneously to the left and right ears through headphones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hearing these binaural beats effectively synchronises and entrains your brainwaves to enhance a specific pattern. It’s a direct physiological response - upon hearing the two tones, your brain perceives a third tone based on the mathematical difference between their frequencies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Your brain then follows along and produces brain waves at the new frequency. The technical term for this process is ‘frequency following response\'. We can use this phenomenon to control the state of our brain waves, tuning them like a radio to dial into the effect that we’re looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are the benefits of modifying our brainwaves?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, we are accustomed to being in the Beta brain rhythm (14-30hz, or cycles per second). We are in a Beta brainwave pattern when we are consciously alert. It’s the default and dominant brainwave for most of us, most of the time. We are in Beta when we feel agitated, tense, hurried, pressured, afraid and stressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we alter our brain rhythm to Alpha (8-13Hz), we are slowing our brainwaves down. This adjustment puts us in the ideal brain state for optimal performance and super learning. Some forms of meditation, relaxation exercises, and activities that enable a sense of calm, also naturally create this Alpha state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to neuroscientists, the effect of decreasing the brain rhythm from Beta to Alpha via deep relaxation techniques, sound therapy and the use of binaural beats entrainment, changes the levels of certain beneficial brain chemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies show that Alpha states significantly increase the release of melatonin, beta-endorphin, norepinephrine and dopamine. These naturally occurring chemicals are linked to feelings of expanded mental clarity and generate an internal environment for new learning and accessing previously learned information. This positive effect lasts for hours and even days.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;brain-wave-state.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\n<p>The creation of binaural beats music has only been possible through technological advancement in the last 100 years or so. But what most people don\'t realise is that the use of this natural science dates back thousands of years. Ancient cultures were aware of the mental effects of sound repetition long before modern science was able to explain the process. They didn\'t refer to this science as binaural beats, but what they did know was that consistent, rhythmic sound had extremely powerful healing and spiritual benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientist Melinda Maxfield has conducted research on drumbeats used during ancient rituals. She found that performers generally beat at a steady rate of 4.5 beats per second. This consistent pulse induces a trance-like state for the tribe, due to the brain shifting into a 4.5 beats-per-second brainwave frequency, which is a low Theta brainwave state (4-7Hz).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the use of repetitive drumming and chanting, Tibetan monks, Native American shamans, Hindu healers and master Yogis have been able to induce specific brainwave states for transcending consciousness, healing, concentration and spiritual growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, you don’t need a drumming shaman to help you reach this beneficial state. All you have to do to take advantage of this knowledge and try out binaural beats for yourself is put on a pair of headphones, relax and press play. It\'s that easy. We recommend listening to at least 12 minutes a day.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can listen to Michelle’s binaural beat meditations on <a href=\"https://mindlikewatermusic.bandcamp.com\">band camp</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n','2020-05-14 09:29:44','2020-11-08 08:25:49','2020-05-14 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/michelle-cade-2.jpg','OTO oundbath',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'ayH8APTIjDU1fmPGZ31zzEQWBTsH0men',0,NULL,'Sound Therapist Michelle Cade tells us how binaural beats can change our state of mind.',NULL),(33,'OTO Interviews Cressida Bonas',NULL,NULL,NULL,'cressida-bonas-and-her-fear-itself',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Cressida Bonas might seem to have nothing to fear. But she’s overcome a lot to get to where she is now: comfortable, content and confident. As season 1 of her podcast Fear Itself, which is sponsored by OTO CBD, comes to an end, we sat down with Cressida to find out how she came to create a podcast about fear and what she’s learnt from her guests about managing her own along the way.</P>\r\n \r\n<p>As a child, Cressida suffered from crippling anxiety over what others might consider small things. She remembers being terrified every time her mother got in the car that something bad would happen to her. This panic, over seemingly insignificant things, was hard to understand and process, taking over her thinking brain and not leaving much room for anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help manage and overcome these feelings of fear, she was encouraged to understand them, and in time, to use her fear as motivation and to push her forward. The digital age, with everyone sharing all aspects of their lives, has led to a fear-based culture, where the pressure to be perfect or even to be ‘fearless’ and brave dominates our subconscious - <span style=\"font-style:italic\"> “it’s intended to make us feel empowered, but I wonder if it does the opposite, encouraging us to deny or run away from our fears”</span>, she says.<span style=\"font-style:italic\"> “I’ve begun to wonder if having fears can also make us brave - because fear can be an incredibly powerful emotion.”</span></p>\r\n \r\n<p>It’s this acknowledgement that led Cressida to start journaling about fear - her own and that of others. She began asking people she met about how they process their fears, what fear means to them and what they have learnt from their fear.</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;cressida-bonas-in-studio.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"cressida bonas in studio\" />\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n<p>The fear that she has experienced throughout her life has a negative side, leading to very powerful thoughts that risked limiting her growth. <span style=\"font-style:italic\">  “As a teenager, my fears would manifest themselves into self-doubt which ultimately crushed my voice and sense of self. Now that I’m able to label the ‘fear’ and find the root of it, it’s not so intense, but my negative thoughts have often felt debilitating and at times very disempowering”</span>. She recalls a quote from the writer Elizabeth Gilbert, who once said that her fear can sit beside her, but she will not let it drive.</p>\r\n<p>Cressida talks very eloquently about moments in the past when she’s frozen or panicked. She looks back at those instances sometimes and thinks,  <span style=\"font-style:italic\"> “what on earth was I worrying about?”</span> - they can seem so insignificant in a world where some fear for their lives and livelihoods on a day-to-day basis. </p>\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>But that is perhaps the key to the topic - fear is directly tied to one’s personal circumstances. Throughout her Fear Itself podcast, Cressida has interviewed a diverse group of individuals with different upbringings, stories and experiences that continually emphasised this personal aspect. Your greatest fear might seem irrelevant to someone else, but it does not make it any less difficult to confront.</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;cressida-bonas-portraits.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\" />\r\n \r\n<p>Being in the public eye since childhood, and belonging to a high-profile family, can manifest certain fears, but Cressida acknowledges how this has encouraged her to develop.  <span style=\"font-style:italic\"> “It has made me grow up a bit faster and has made me understand what’s important and what’s not important in life.”</span> She knew it was important to cultivate her own sense of identity and to fiercely protect what was true: especially when there is a danger of your truth being dictated by someone else, or something false being projected onto you.</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Once Cressida had started journals of her conversations around fear with others, it was a natural next step for Cressida’s to transfer her written discussions into recordings, she has always been a big podcast fan,<span style=\"font-style:italic\">  “I love hearing other people’s stories, thoughts and opinions and I think it can be a great way of connecting people”</span>, and she thought that the topic would resonate with listeners - hearing other people’s personal stories around this subject, particularly those who have found a way ‘through’ fear can be hugely inspiring and she hoped, helpful.<span style=\"font-style:italic\">  “I wanted to challenge the idea of fear as a negative, disabling concept – and encourage us to recognise it, share stories about it, channel it and ultimately channel it to move forward.”</span></p>\r\n \r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;cressida-bonas-studio-2.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"cressida bonas in the studio\" />\r\n \r\n<p>Ironically, however, she very nearly didn’t make the podcast because of her own fear. Recording your conversations is a very intimate activity, you’re opening yourself up to the fear of rejection and making yourself vulnerable. Especially when she’s fought so hard to protect her identity and privacy while being in the public eye, this exposure is difficult to ignore. However, she recognised that fear is universal, and there is no learning or growth in the comfortable. It’s only when we step outside of our comfort zones that we learn more about ourselves, Once Cressida realised that her explorations could inspire or encourage others - the fear and uncertainty lifted.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>When she started this project, over a year ago, no-one had any idea that she’d be releasing the podcasts during a global pandemic, Cressida thought very carefully about whether or not to go ahead with the launch as many people are, understandably, fearing for themselves, the economy, their loved ones and neighbours. However, it seems that podcasts are more important than ever now. They can bring moments of connection, escapism and entertainment, making people feel less alone. At a time when most conversations are around coping with and managing fear, we can all draw some much-needed support and inspiration from Cressida and her guests. Frankly, it’s just a surprise that no one has covered the topic before.</p>\r\n \r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;magefan_blog/ellie_goulding_cressida_bonas.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"cressida bones and Ellie goulding\" />\r\n \r\n \r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:40px\">CRESSIDA’S TOP TIPS TO HELP YOU MANAGE YOUR FEAR & ANXIETY</h2>\r\n<ol style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:16px\"><li>	Visualise.

Put plainly, we’re struggling to concentrate now more of us are working from home for the first time. Lockdown has led a nation into a focus crisis. The good news is there are things you can do help you find focus. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The sudden transition to full-time home life - the first time working away from an office for many of us - has not been easy. Being home day in, day out - under the weight of government guidelines and a global pandemic - takes its toll. Blurred lines between work and personal life, consuming more media than ever and somehow feeling ‘always on’ even behind closed doors, it can be hard to understand and process our feelings. On top of that, it can be hard to figure out how and where to focus our attention. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the pandemic, it’s business-as-normal for a lot of companies and their employees. Business-as-normal…but the ‘new normal’, conducting everything digitally. We have new work pressures on top of the old deadlines and targets - how is your wifi holding up? Trying to parent and look after and/or teach your children? Found a quiet spot in your house for the umpteenth Zoom call of the day? With more stressors than ever, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and even easier to forget that while we’re trying to survive and adapt, it can be hard to feel like you’re thriving, no matter how many loaves of banana bread you bake.</p>\r\n\r\n{{widget type=\"Magento\\Cms\\Block\\Widget\\Block\" template=\"widget/static_block/default.phtml\" block_id=\"44\"}}\r\n\r\n<p>While there’s a myriad of articles that list things like calendar blocking your day to maintain a sense of routine, dedicating a clear workspace and taking breaks, these solutions only treat the symptom, not the problem. If you’ve implemented these and you’re still finding productivity hard to come by, CBD can help. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBD (cannabidiol) is a molecule found in hemp plants that matches one naturally produced in our own bodies in the endocannabinoid system. This system helps keep the body in balance, or, to use the technical term, homeostasis. It works by communicating to cells, hormones and neurone transmitters that they need to regulate back to their happy equilibrium. If the endocannabinoid system isn’t functioning well, you are more susceptible to conditions like anxiety, stress, pain and inflammation. It can also be hard to find the motivation to prioritise and deliver when we’re struggling to manage symptoms of stress and anxiety. By supplementing the body with plant-made cannabinoids, you can help with the management of these conditions, and by extension, aid focus and attention. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/finding-focus-3.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"Finding focus\" />\r\n\r\n<p>OTO has a dedicated <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/shop-by-benefits/cbd-for-productivity-and-focus.html\">Focus range of products</a>, designed specifically to aid focus and productivity.

Literally. Choose your workspace and make it a stress-free zone of quiet and solitude, so that other members of your household can allow you to concentrate and you can keep your work and home life relatively separate. If you don’t have a separate room, find an area with minimum traffic from the rest of your household, so you don’t get distracted. Going to this same place every day will help tell your mind that it’s time to focus, not time to wander, however, try to maintain the same hours you would have spent at the office so that you don’t burn out. </li>\r\n\r\n<li>Use CBD to encourage homeostasis within the body and alleviate symptoms of stress and aches & pain as well as improving the quality of your sleep, so that you have no physical ailments pulling your attention throughout the day and you can concentrate on the task in hand.  </li>\r\n\r\n<li>Use your video more than you would, encourage your colleagues to have Zoom meetings so that you stay connected. And if you start to feel isolated and it begins to detract from your work, consider setting up a support group of friends or colleagues who are also working from home, meeting on a regular basis and sharing creative ways you’ve adjusted to the new situation.\r\n\r\n<li>Be aware of cabin fever, particularly for your new little workspace – get outside as much as possible, even if it’s just a walk around the block research shows that spending time outside lowers stress, helps you relax and clears your mind.  </li>\r\n\r\n<li>Remember to plan time in for yourself – self-care is relevant now more than ever, and this means something different for everybody. Things like our virtual soundbaths and breathing videos are a great way to fit this into your new routine easily, or simply taking a minute every couple of hours to rub one of our OTO Roll-On CBD oils on your temples and pulse points, particularly our Focus oil, will help bring you back into the moment and focus the mind. </li></oL>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Click<a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/shop-by-benefits/cbd-for-productivity-and-focus.html\"> here to discover the power of CBD and shop the Focus range.</p>\r\n\r\n','2020-05-27 10:34:21','2020-11-08 08:16:19','2020-05-27 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/finding-focus.jpg','finding focus in the normal',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'4eXWTKiM5jfMxTObz2mVcjQ4iCnXs252',0,NULL,'How to find focus during lockdown.',NULL),(36,'Stress Busting Food with Marie Claire\'s Lisa Oxenham',NULL,NULL,NULL,'stress-busting-food-with-marie-claires-lisa-oxenham',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Studies prove that eating the right food can play a role in managing and relieving anxiety.

As nutritionist <a href=\"https://www.nicola-moore.com\">Nicola Moore</a> explains <span style=\"font-style:italic\">“reaching for junk food and alcohol is common through moments of stress because it’s fast, firing off the happy hormones and giving a brief moment of comfort.”</span>The only problem is that once that initial high has passed, you’re left worse off:<span style=\"font-style:italic\"> “that sweet fix can cause a sugar spike, just to be left low, subdued and with a lack of energy.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than reach for the chocolate every time you feel a bit defeated, Moore suggests perhaps making tweaks to encourage your diet to subtly influence your mental health, manage your anxiety and lift your mood. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n <img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/lisa-oxenham-2.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"Lisa Oxenham talks about CBD bitters\" />\r\n<p style=\"font-size:smaller\">Photographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ithakaroddam\">@ithakaroddam</a> Artist:  <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stacieart\">@stacie_art</a> .

Water makes up around 70 percent of the body. It carries hormones and nutrients to their destinations, so when fluid consumption is reduced, this process slows down and blood pressure can drop. Nicola says that this can lead to dizziness and as the heart tries to increase low blood pressure - and the associated faster heartbeat may feel similar to a panic attack, which can then prompt anxiety. <span style=\"font-style:italic\">“Get into the habit of starting the day with a hydrating glass of water, and try to consume around six to eight glasses a day,”</span>she advises.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-top:4rem\">ELIMINATE ALCOHOL</h2>\r\n<p>In times of stress, Moore advises reducing foods and drinks that have a negative impact on bacterial balance in your digestive tract. These include sugar and alcohol. <span style=\"font-style:italic\">“Drinking alcohol also reduces the amount of serotonin in the brain, which is a neurotransmitter that helps you to feel calm and happy,”</span>she says. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-top:4rem\">ADD CBD</h2>\r\n<p>Research suggests that CBD helps the body process serotonin, and can also aid sleep and alleviate insomnia (both of which can exacerbate feelings of anxiety). The <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/oto-cbd-bitters.html\">OTO non-alcoholic CBD bitters</a> have been designed to improve overall wellbeing. Optimum-strength CBD, cultivated from organically grown hemp plants, has been combined with a bespoke range of botanicals with antioxidant properties, to help with stress and anxiety and promote calmness and contentment.</p>\r\n \r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:4rem\">REDUCE CAFFEINE</h2>\r\n<p><span=\"font-style:italic\">“Caffeine can be a ‘silent’ stressor that can trigger adrenalin production and therefore anxiety,”</span> says Nicola.<span style=\"font-style:italic\"> “Caffeine is a powerful stimulant designed to keep you alert and energised - but too much can trigger the “fight or flight” response, causing you to overreact to situations that aren’t actually dangerous.”</span> </p>\r\n \r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:4rem\">EAT REGULAR AND BALANCED MEALS</h2>\r\n <p>Incorporate whole grains, some protein, vegetables, and natural fat into your diet to keep blood sugar balanced and consistent. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:4rem\">CONSIDER THE “GUT-BRAIN AXIS”</h2>\r\n<p>About 95% of serotonin receptors are found in the lining of the gut. Probiotics, which foster a healthy gut environment, are now being looked at to treat anxiety and depression. Try eating probiotic-rich foods such as pickles, sauerkraut, and kefir.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:4rem\">UP YOUR OMEGA-3 INTAKE</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic\">“Optimise your diet to include lots of omega 3 fats, as they\'re linked to improving depression and anxiety. Wild Alaskan salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel, anchovies, chia seeds, flaxseeds and walnuts are all great sources,”</span> says Nicola. </p>\r\n \r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:4rem\">BOOST B VITAMINS</h2>\r\n<p> Feel-good foods include avocado and almonds - and foods rich in B vitamins, because <span style=\"font-style:italic\">“they encourage the release of neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine.”</span> </p>\r\n \r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:4rem\">FILL UP ON ANTIXOIDANT-RICH FOODS</h2>\r\n<p>Enhancing your diet with antioxidant-potent food may help ease the symptoms of stress anxiety. <span style=\"font-style:italic\">“Fuel up on red, pinto, black, and red kidney beans, apples, prunes, plums, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries, walnuts and pecans, artichokes, kale, spinach, beetroot, broccoli, turmeric, and ginger,”</span> says Nicola. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style:italic>Note: more research is needed to fully understand the role of nutritional psychiatry and it is not a substitute for medical interventions. \r\n</p>\r\n','2020-05-28 11:14:00','2020-05-29 05:37:38','2020-05-28 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/lisa-oxenham-3.jpg','Lisa Oxenham talks about Stress Busting Foods',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'9dYi4wZOWqiDpXTXmNVsEvraF2HML112',0,NULL,'Marie Claire’s Lisa Oxenham shares some healthy-eating tips to tame stress during these uncertain times',NULL),(37,'TEST BLOG',NULL,NULL,NULL,'test-blog',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>This is the blog</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pillow-mist-mask-402.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"Pillow Mist\" width=\"1200\"></p>','2020-06-02 15:52:02','2020-06-02 15:52:08','2020-06-02 15:52:02',0,1,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'iS54PTt6GLx2pcgqpwXxVCPDX2onoR5C',0,NULL,'Inside is this',NULL),(38,'Is Lockdown Keeping You Up?',NULL,NULL,NULL,'is-lockdown-keeping-you-up',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p style=\"font-weight:bold\">A  recently published BBC article brought to light the worrying results of a UK sleep survey: <span style=\"font-style:italic\">‘More than half the UK population has struggled with sleep during the lockdown’.</span>\r\nA 2017 Sleep Council study had already found that 35% of us had been experiencing sleeping problems for over five years; with 74% of us sleeping less than the recommended 7 hours a night.

And at £69 RRP, we think it’s worth every peaceful minute.</P>\r\n\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/cbd-sleep/oto-sleep-drops.html\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/sleep-drops-ingredients.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold\">What other things can you do to help?</p>\r\n\r\n<P>The BBC article suggests <span style=\"font-style:italic\"> ‘keeping to a routine, not taking naps and trying to get some exercise outside’</span>, which are all very helpful points and a great place to start when thinking about your general health and wellbeing. OTO scientists, Dr Ketan Joshi and Dr Michael Haslam have also shared with us their top tips for better sleep:</P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-top:4rem\">1. CREATE A ROUTINE</h2>\r\n\r\n<P>In today’s hectic modern world, this is perhaps easier said than done. However, creating a regular schedule will programme the brain and sleep cycle into a set routine. Your internal body clock is the greatest sleep tool and it can take between three to ten days to reset, so it is important to keep your sleep habits consistent. Developing a pre-bedtime routine that starts an hour or so before you sleep will allow you to wind down and clear your head. This hour will massively help your sleep quality and it should be a moment of calm. We suggest taking a bath, reading or meditating.</P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-top:4rem\">2. PUT THE PHONE AWAY</h2>\r\n\r\n<P>We all know the impact ‘blue light’ has on sleep, but it can be hard to switch off and break free. Here are some tips to break the addiction. Switch your phone to ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode at least an hour before bed. This will stop any notifications or calls coming through, allowing you to slowly disengage from the outside world. ‘Downtime’ also allows you to switch off access to apps during set times – perfect for stopping pre-bedtime social media scrolling. Setting ‘night shift’ on your phone in the evening will adjust your screen from blue to yellow light which is softer on your eyes. If you still can’t resist the urge to reach for your phone, tuck it away at the opposite side of the room out of arm’s reach.</P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-top:4rem\">3. COMFORT IS KEY</h2>\r\n\r\n<P>Investing in a good quality bed, mattress and bedding can do wonders for a good night’s sleep. Of the three, investing in a mattress is the most essential as a bad mattress won’t just affect your sleep, it can also result in back and joint pain. A lot of skill goes into making premium mattresses and the difference really is noticeable. Although they can come with a hefty price tag, spending a third of your life in bed means it’s worth spending a little more time considering your options.</P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-top:4rem\">4. OPTIMISE YOUR BEDROOM</h2>\r\n\r\n<P>Noise, light pollution and temperature can all affect sleep; so creating the right conditions can help. Make sure the room is cool, ideally between 16-18°C. CBD will also be of benefit here, as it helps the body remain calm and balanced, naturally assisting with symptoms of overheating. Make sure all light-emitting electronics are switched off (think stand-by buttons, electric clocks etc.) and consider blackout curtains if you’re a particularly light sleeper. Noise can be harder to control - especially if you live in a busy area - however, a lot of people recommend white noise machines. They work by generating high-pitched static consisting of randomised frequencies to aid sleep. </P>','2020-06-10 16:00:22','2020-11-08 08:15:43','2020-06-10 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/sleep-drops-blog.jpg','OTO Sleep Drops',10,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'YcyTb75ayadkBEWnM9TlEsYZVzUD0qvE',0,NULL,'Top 4 Tips and brand new OTO CBD Sleep Drops to tackle lockdown sleeping problems affecting more than half of us.

Share social moments&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting with the people around you is key to your wellbeing, which is particularly important during challenging periods. We are social creatures and therefore self-isolating and social distancing can be difficult.</span></p>\r\n<p>Even through lockdown, using online platforms means we can continue to see family, friends and colleagues. Whether it\'s on Zoom, FaceTime or even a phone call, be sure to keep in touch and stay connected.</p>\r\n<p>James and Gemma founded OTO, so you could say wellness and wellbeing are somewhat in their wheelhouse! ⁠They are true inspirations and role models to all of us at OTO, and love sharing small moments with those around them.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we asked what Gemma\'s go to wellness advice is, she said:⁠</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠</span>‘<em>Smiles and laughter! I put Florence and the Machine on really loudly and dance round the kitchen with Leo (my 3 year old) singing ‘you’ve got the love’! It’s Leo’s favourite song and it never fails to make me smile</em>’.⁠</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠</span>Smiling makes us feel good, and feeling good makes us smile, producing endorphins which help alleviate stress. Laughing is also a great way to release intense emotions and boost our immune system.⁠</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For James, it’s all about taking the time to soak in and appreciate the small pleasures in life: ⁠</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠</span>‘<em>If it’s not receiving a big hug from a loved one - then it’s enjoying good wine, good music, and a good view</em>’.⁠</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both social contact and exposure to nature are well known ways to boost mental health, general mood and wellbeing. They are simple ways to feel connected to the world around you. These moments may have been in shorter supply recently, but even picking up the phone or going for a quick stroll in the park can do the trick.⁠</span></p>\r\n<p><br><br><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/drink-water_2_.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2. Take care or your body</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introducing exercise into your routine has proven benefits – find a physical activity that you enjoy and that suits your level of mobility and fitness.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A balanced diet is equally important, as it can help increase energy levels,&nbsp; improve feelings of wellbeing and happiness whilst also boosting your mental function and even enhancing memory.</span></p>\r\n<p>Don’t forget to drink plenty of water too - Nigel, our Digital Director shares his short but effective top tip:</p>\r\n<p><em>‘If you feel like snacking, drink a glass of water instead’.</em></p>\r\n<p>Keeping hydrated is key to staying focused throughout the day. It’s also needed to help maintain the functioning of pretty much every system in the human body, from your heart to your brain and muscles. We’d say that’s definitely worth keeping on top of and find having a large refillable bottle on hand to do the trick. You can even pop in some fresh fruit and a dash of our CBD bitters to give it an extra health boosting twist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rina, our Commercial Product &amp; Planning Director personally loves yoga as a way to refocus and relax. She shares her top tips for practicing yoga at home - something she’s spent more time doing through lockdown:⁠</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘Yoga is where I feel balanced, especially during times like these. Bringing focus into my practice helps me remain present in my every day. Since practising more at home, I’ve added some personal touches by making the most of Spotify’s many playlists, burning fragrant candles and using our <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/cbd-roll-ons/oto-focus-20-percent-cbd-essential-oil.html\">OTO Focus CBD Roll-On Oil</a>’.⁠</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoga has been practiced worldwide for centuries as a way to promote physical and mental wellbeing. Finding personal touches like your favourite music or scent to deepen your practice is a lovely way to take your self care routine to the next level.

And your mind too!&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It’s important to keep mentally fit as well as physically, and while we may feel physically fine, everyday emotions can have an impact on our wellbeing. Our mind and body and very much interlinked, and one can and will affect the other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small day-to-day activities can be undertaken to improve mental health, including:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">De-cluttering your space - a tidy home and workspace often equals a tidy mind, and can help us to feel more in control and less stressed</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being mindful of your surroundings and focusing on the present moment also helps you to feel grateful and thankful</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-development, such as improving or learning a skill, helps develop levels of confidence, motivation and self-awareness</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For OTO Account Manager Rachel, being&nbsp; more present and enjoying the moment usually looks like this:</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘I love to spend Sunday afternoons cooking sugo (with enough to freeze for a very thankful future-me), it reminds me of my childhood and I feel very cathartic. I also enjoy making my Mum’s famous chicken soup - it really does heal the soul! Franco Manca pizza, enough said. I also like to read my favourite books and paint my nails’.⁠</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">⁠</span>Cooking is a great act of patience, mindfulness and outlet for creative expression. Reading is also a fantastic way to strengthen your brain, reduce stress and aid sleep. So it’s a big thumbs up from the whole team!⁠</p>\r\n<p><br><br></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/sleep-relax_1_.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>4. Sleep&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep is a cornerstone of what we want to help our community with at OTO. In busy or particularly stressful times, we like to say our motto is ‘work hard, sleep hard’. It allows our bodies to restore and repair. as well as our brains to consolidate our memories and process information. Poor sleep is linked to several physical problems, such as a weakened immune system, and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Here are some useful tips to helping you get a good night\'s sleep:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cut caffeine out of your diet earlier in the day</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid screens 2 hours before sleeping, as the blue light emitted suppresses the secretion of melatonin (a sleep-inducing hormone)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set the right temperature; sleep experts recommend between 15°C - 19°C.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remove distractions by blocking out light and noise where possible</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try keeping your phone out of reach when going to bed</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going on long walks can help improve your sleep, as our Marketing Manager Ellie explains:</span></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘My top tip would be to get outside into the countryside, breathe in some fresh air and explore! Each time I go on a walk, I always take a new route to mix it up. This allows me to discover areas I haven’t been to before, I come across beautiful scenery and it takes me on different adventures! It’s so important to get out of busy built-up cities and into open spaces to recharge my batteries’.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going on walks can do wonders for your wellbeing – it has been shown to improve your mood and quality of sleep, whilst also reducing stress, anxiety and fatigue.

But good sleep is bloody hard to come by!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when we released our brand new OTO CBD Sleep Drops just over a month ago, the whole team was immensely proud. Somehow under complete lockdown and with everyone working remotely we managed to launch the most innovative CBD tincture on the market - which would have been a feat even under the best of circumstances.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has been a long time in the making. Our mission is to encourage people to discover the power of CBD, by creating thoughtful and effective products that easily and enjoyably fit into their daily lives. In order to stay true to our mission, we knew that we could not ignore one of the largest segments of the CBD market, but we had the very real ambition to develop something that represented true innovation within the drops/tincture category. The whole team has worked incredibly hard over the last 8 months to develop the best tincture money can buy - and now it’s here. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\"> ‘Given the challenging circumstances of bringing this product to life, I have to say it’s the one I’m most proud of’. - Rina Bhansali, Production Director, OTO</p>\r\n<p>The drops became a bedtime essential for the whole team. It’s safe to say that we were all relieved to finally be catching up on some much-needed sleep, as we had all been struggling a little more than usual but weren’t quite sure why.</p><p> The next week t<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52911395\">his BBC article</a> landed, highlighting the concerning result of their latest sleep survey:</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52911395\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/bbc-4.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"More than half the UK population has struggled with sleep during the lockdown\" /></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--<p style=\"font-weight:bold\">\"More than half the UK population has struggled with sleep during the lockdown\" </p>-->\r\n\r\n<p>That was when the penny really dropped. Not only had we just launched a market-leading product, but we had done so in time to answer a very real, new and pressing consumer need. Now, more people than ever need support to take care of their minds and bodies, and ultimately achieve their vital daily requirement of a good night’s sleep. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sleep is essential to our health. For the body and mind to restore and regenerate. Having been someone who has struggled with sleep a lot throughout my life, it is undeniable how much of an impact a good night’s sleep has on my overall wellbeing. It helps you feel positive, refreshed, reinvigorated and ready to take on the day with all the energy and confidence you deserve. You cannot reach your full potential without sleep, that’s why it represents one of the key cornerstones of our product range at OTO.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the success of our now award-winning Pillow Mist - used by the lovely Cressida Bonas and Jodie Kidd no less - we knew we needed to broaden out our Sleep range. First we developed our incredible range of Night-time Skincare. This range contains the highest concentrations of CBD within the global skincare market, and works with your body to regenerate, renew and repair your skin whilst you sleep. This range is now loved by skincare enthusiasts across the UK and to truly complete our Sleep range, we wanted to tackle a drop. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/cressiada-quote-2.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\n<p>When looking at drops and tinctures, it can’t be denied that most of them are quite unpleasant to use, often tasting quite bitter and grassy. It can also be quite challenging to get the dosage right; and the last thing you want before going to bed is to have to worry about counting drops or measuring mls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four main reasons why people really do love our Sleep Drops:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b>They taste amazing. </b>We spent a lot of time getting the taste and flavour profile perfect. We were keen to make the product light and refreshing, with a combination of the highest quality 100% natural coconut, lavender, liquorice and field mint extracts. You really get a delicious and subtle minty flavour, which is perfect to easily fit into your bedtime routine, e.g after brushing your teeth.  </li>\r\n<li><b>The unique product elements make it the easiest tincture to use.</b>Going to bed needs to be as stress-free as possible and so using our Sleep Drops needed to be too. So much love, care and effort went into designing our bottle; and the result is that it delivers the exact dose you need to start drifting away - at the simple click of a button.</li>\r\n<li><b>They really do work. </b>Like all of our OTO products, our Sleep Drops come with our OTOStrength guarantee of optimum and truly effective levels of the highest quality, pure CBD isolate. With 10% CBD and a complementary blend of organic, hand- picked botanical extracts like lavender and butterfly pea flower, these ingredients were specially selected to help you wind down and relax for bedtime. <br><br>I was absolutely stunned when our customer trial results came back. They were even better than expected, especially given the rigorous approach we took. My favourite stat… trialists reporting ‘Very good’ or ‘Good’ overall sleep quality went from 8% before Sleep Drops usage to 62% at the end of the trial. That’s an <b>8x increase </b>in people getting Good to Very Good sleep using our product! <br><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-style:italic\">‘I loved it and have been raving to all my friends about them. I\'m so pleased that my hunch <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/amplify-cbd-body-oil-1.html\">CBD oil</a> might be a way to improve my sleep issues.

The heat makes us feel lethargic throughout the day, yet makes it impossible to sleep at night. The result? A nation of grumpy, sleepless zombies... and that\'s where CBD comes in. ⁠</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:6rem\">CBD & SLEEP</h2>\r\n⁠\r\n<p>Anecdotally, hemp, the mother plant of CBD, has been used as a sleep aid for centuries. Gretchen Lidicker, author of <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/\">CBD Oil</a>: Everyday Secrets: A Lifestyle Guide to Hemp-Derived Health and Wellness, notes that sleep was positively affected by CBD thanks to its anti-anxiety properties and ability to promote relaxation.⁠</p>\r\n⁠\r\n<p>CBD  may even help with chronic insomnia more than the typically prescribed melatonin. While melatonin signals to the body that it’s time to go to sleep, the sleep-wake system that promotes and drives healthy sleeping patterns is regulated by the presence of CBD in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s no one size fits all solution for a better night’s sleep, especially when factors such as the heat are disrupting your space, but the NHS suggests a regular night time routine as one of the keys to getting a good sleep: a quiet mind, relaxed body and calm bedroom. With this in mind, we created our Balance range, combining our premium, high-strength CBD with carefully curated essential oils that are regarded for their ability to improve sleep; think lavender, chamomile and cajeput.⁠</p>\r\n⁠\r\n<p>The benefits of our Balance products - pillow mist, sleep drops and night skincare - are that they help your body reach the optimum conditions for a good night’s sleep, without making you actually drowsy. Our <a href=\"/journal/post/i-loved-it-oto-sleep-drops-trials-are-a-success\"> extensive consumer trials</a>  showed that the Balance range can help you fall asleep easily, but, more importantly, stay asleep and wake up refreshed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/sleeping-heatwave-2.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\n<p>To help complement our Balance products, I sat down with Gemma and my fellow OTO scientist, Dr Ketan Joshi to discuss our top tips on how to beat the heat and stay cool all through the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Regulate your body temperature</span><br>\r\nGoing to bed cool, calm and collected puts you in the best position to fall asleep, and stay asleep. CBD is an effective tool to help regulate your body temperature as it promotes homeostasis - or balance - within the body, restoring it to its optimal state. Try using our new  <a href=\"/shop/oto-sleep-drops.html\">Sleep Drops</a>, or having one of our <a href=\"/balance-cbd-shot.html\">Balance CBD Shots</a> about half an hour before bed.</li>\r\n\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Turn your hot water bottle into a cold water bottle</span><br>\r\nYou’ve all heard of a hot water bottle, but what about trying a cold water bottle? Fill up your hot water bottle with cold water (not too full, frozen water expands and you don’t want it to burst) and put it in the freezer for a few hours. Then when frozen, put the cover back on and take it to bed with you - it’s like the cold side of the pillow, but it lasts longer. </li>\r\n\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Take a nap</span><br>\r\nWhen you don’t get enough sleep, you rack up a ‘sleep debt’ - this is the cumulative amount of sleep that you’ve missed out on and it can cause problems in the long-term. Try to squeeze in a little snooze when you can  (it’s one of the perks of working from home). </li>\r\n\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Lavender, lavender, lavender</span><br>\r\n… or another sleep-promoting essential oil like chamomile or cajeput. Adding one or more of these scents to your nighttime environment will signal to your body to start winding down, helping to put you in the right frame of mind to get to sleep and stay asleep. Try our award-winning <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/oto-cbd-pillow-mist.html\">Pillow Mist</a>, which blends lavender, chamomile and cajeput, or use our<a href=\"/oto-balance-cbd-body-oil.html\"> Balance Body Oil</a> before bed, which is made with chamomile and fragonia, known for their powerful balancing and calming properties. </li>\r\n\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Avoid alcohol</span><br>\r\nAlthough alcohol allows you to fall asleep quickly, it disturbs the quality of your sleep, which is just as important. So make the switch to non-alcoholic drinks while the weather is hot or for a few hours before bedtime, as not only will this help keep you hydrated, your body will thank you later (and in the morning!). Our <a href=\"/oto-cbd-bitters.html\">CBD Bitters</a> are an effective and functional alternative to alcohol, helping you to feel present in the moment and allowing you to enjoy a sophisticated drink while you’re not drinking.

And I thought the best way to celebrate with you was to share our very own OTO guide to everything you need to know about CBD.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be a complex and confusing world out there - so being informed and knowing what to look out for can really help separate the just-OK from the knock-your-socks-off-amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, here we go! (pats on backs if you know it already)...</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is CBD?</h2>\r\n<p>CBD stands for Cannabidiol, and is a completely natural compound derived from the hemp plant that has been declared safe by the World Health Organisation. You won\'t get high and, in fact, our bodies already produce a very similar substance to CBD on its own, known as Endogenous Cannabinoids.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How does CBD interact with the human body?</h2>\r\n<p>All cannabinoids, whether produced by the body or extracted from the hemp plant, react with a complex network of cannabinoid receptors found in the body, known as the Human Endocannabinoid System (HES). The HES is responsible for creating homeostasis - or balance - within the body, as well as regulating physiological functions such as: aiding pain management and reducing inflammation; encouraging healthy sleeping patterns; positively influencing mood; and reducing stress and anxiety - to name just a few.\r\nHuman Endogenous Cannabinoids are produced by our body on demand and are not stored or constant. Often levels can deplete and as such our sleep may suffer or we may feel higher levels of anxiety or pain. By supplementing our natural Endogenous Cannabinoids with plant-based CBD, it can help restore homeostasis within the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Does CBD work? What can it help with?</h2>\r\n<p>We are only just beginning to understand the potential of this incredible molecule, but research and anecdotal evidence is revealing how CBD can help with sleep, stress, mood and certain skin conditions, as well as pain management and inflammation. In our <a href=\"/journal/post/i-loved-it-oto-sleep-drops-trials-are-a-success\">own consumer trials</a>, out of 87 participants, 83% said regular use of OTO helped them to fall asleep and stay asleep, whilst 86% said it helped with their stress and anxiety and 92% reported an improvement in mood, energy and relationships.<p>\r\n<p>There are so many ways that CBD is transforming people’s lives and every day we hear incredible stories from our customers on how our products have helped them. From the yoga teacher who uses it to manage the deliberating pain she experiences from endometriosis to the young professional who has used our body oils to treat a persistent dry skin condition that has affected her for the past seven years despite countless trips to her GP and dermatologists.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/national-cbd-day.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"national cbd day\" />\r\n\r\n<h2>What are the best ways to use CBD?</h2>\r\n<p>One of the best things about CBD is how versatile it is. You can drink it, use it in skin creams, add it to food, breath it in, and more. At OTO we’ve worked hard to bring you the most enjoyable and effective ways to make CBD part of your daily ritual. We particularly focus on bioavailability - the ways that your body absorbs CBD and gets it to where it’s needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, one popular method is to hold an oil with CBD under your tongue. This allows the membranes in your mouth to quickly absorb it (the scientific term for this is ‘oromuscosal’ absorption). And as a result, the CBD can more easily reach your bloodstream. We specifically created our new<a href=\"/oto-sleep-drops.html \">OTO Sleep Drops</a> to take advantage of this process, helping you relax faster in preparation for bedtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drinking or eating a CBD-infused products means it will first have to go through your digestive system. Less of the CBD in the product will actually be available to your body (it has lower bioavailability) because more of it will be broken down before it reaches your system. However, drinking <a href=\"/shop/drinks.html\">CBD products</a> with a meal has been proven to boost its absorption, especially if the meal is higher in fat - an excuse to indulge! There are also benefits for your oral and gut-health by ingesting CBD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about skin products? As you might expect, much less CBD will reach your bloodstream when used topically on your skin - which is doing its natural job as a protective barrier. The good news is that <a href=\"/shop/cbd-skincare.html\">OTO skincare products</a> have been specifically designed to help CBD penetrate through the skin, by using oils high in oleic acid and carrier terpenes. Once through the tougher epidermal layers, CBD can then get to work balancing skin oils, helping with inflammation, pain and even irritation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>How much do I need to take?</h2>\r\n<p>Through extensive research, our team of world-leading scientists determined that for a healthy lifestyle, the optimum daily dose of CBD is between 40 - 60mg. This figure is also supported by other leading experts within the field of CBD.</p>\r\n<p>All of our products are designed to deliver this amount of CBD per day - which we call our OTOStrength guarantee. When shopping for CBD products, make sure you opt for optimum-strength products that are easy to dose. Most products on the market contain ineffective levels of CBD and therefore you are unlikely to experience any of the benefits at all. OTO gives you peace of mind that all of our products deliver the recommended daily amount in a safe, enjoyable and effective way. No confusing variables, no misleading promises, just powerful and transformative CBD experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What makes OTO unique?</h2>\r\n<p>Having discovered the power of CBD in California, I was disappointed upon my return to the UK by the products on offer. Not only did most contain really low levels of CBD that would be ineffective, I also found dropping the oil tinctures under my tongue to be an unpleasant experience. On top of that, a lot of products were confusing and difficult to navigate.</p>\r\n<p>Together with a group of friends including leading scientists, entrepreneurs and anthropologists, we set out to create the world’s finest CBD experiences and thus... OTO was born.</p>\r\n<p>We launched in 2019 with a trio of 20% <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/\">CBD oil</a>\r\n roll-ons that are applied to pulse points where the CBD is easily absorbed transdermally through the skin. Each of the oils is designed to become part of your daily ritual and can be enjoyed at key moments in your day. We call these moments our three pillars - <a href=\"/shop.html?moment_select=25\">Focus</a> - which is our daytime pillar; <a href=\"/shop.html?moment_select=26\">Amplify</a> - perfect for social moments and <a href=\"/shop.html?moment_select=27\">Balance </a>- which is designed for your pre-bedtime ritual.</p>\r\n<p>Everything we create comes with our OTOStrength guarantee, so you can be assured that you are receiving the optimum amount of CBD per day. All our products feature high-quality, ayurvedic botanicals to enhance the benefits of the CBD and are made in the UK, are cruelty free and vegan.</p>\r\n<p>Most importantly, what makes OTO unique is that OTO works. From improved sleep to reduced anxiety and better skin, our products have transformed so many people’s lives over the past 12 months. We look forward to helping many more people discover the power of CBD throughout 2020 and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>There are so many different brands and prices out there - how do I know what to look for?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We know shopping for CBD products can be a little daunting. The main reason that we started OTO was to create products that you could rely on - we’ve done all the hard work of making sure that they’re made from only the highest-quality ingredients with amounts of CBD that can actually help you. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>When considering buying CBD products, here’s our guide on what to look out for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Is the company including enough CBD in their products to account for different bioavailabilities?</span><br>\r\n    For example, putting just a few milligrams in a drink is unlikely to give you the effect you’re after.</li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Does the brand develop its own products, ensuring that they can thoughtfully tailor each one to best help you? </span><br>Look for companies that are not simply putting their own label on a standard, mass market product. </li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Is the company clearly telling you how much CBD is in the product, along with all the other ingredients?</span><br> If you’re looking to CBD to improve your homeostasis, adding a lot of sugar or preservatives is not the best way to find balance. The non-CBD ingredients can be as important as the CBD itself, adding their own benefits if carefully chosen by the brand to enhance CBD’s effects.</li>\r\n        <li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Is the product stocked by reputable retailers? </span><br>It actually takes a lot to convince high-end stores to put a brand on their shelves - if the store has done the hard work of finding reliable CBD brands for you, take advantage of it!</li>\r\n            <li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Does the product include batch numbers, ‘best-by’ dates and other standard expectations for safe and reputable products?</span><br> Also, when it comes to CBD, if you have doubts you should be able to ask the company for their ‘certificate of analysis’ showing the cannabinoid profile and absence of THC, heavy metals or other nasty’s in their products.</li>\r\n                <li><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Finally, consider what you want to get from your CBD products.</span><br> Remember to pay attention to how you feel when using a particular product, and over time your body will be the best guide to what works for you.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To truly help celebrate National CBD Day we’re offering you 20% off OTO products this weekend.

Urban life, with all this information, good and bad, at our fingertips and in our pockets makes it increasingly difficult to carve out time to relax. According to research by the Mental Health Foundation, nearly half of the population of Britain feel more anxious now than they ever used to, with many of the participants admitting to feeling anxious on a daily basis. Niggles, stressors, anxiety triggers or notifications distract us from switching off.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Being subjected to stress on a daily basis can not only threaten your mental health, but also impact your physical health and your relationships. Prioritising relaxation can help us to feel more balanced when we are dealing with the stresses and anxieties that come with our connected lifestyles. When we are relaxed, we feel more confident, comfortable and happy - beneficial both in our professional lives and when we’re building personal relationships and spending time with friends.</p>\r\n<p>CBD can help.

And she lauded CBD as a natural way to reduce the impact of stresses that were keeping me from living my best life.</p>\r\n<p>It worked. That\'s because CBD has a powerful effect on both the behavioural and physiological symptoms of stress, helping us to find balance within our bodies and in turn, making it easier for us to relax. During OTO’s extensive <a href=\"/journal/post/i-loved-it-oto-sleep-drops-trials-are-a-success\">consumer trials</a>, 85% of participants who previously said that they regularly have trouble relaxing, benefited from using OTO. </p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/cbd-relax-2.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<p>How it works is down to the CBD molecule that comes from hemp plants and is similar to a molecule we produce in our own bodies. CBD reacts with a complex network of receptors through the body to promote homeostasis, or balance, within the body. It also helps regulate physiological functions such as encouraging healthy sleeping patterns; positively influencing mood; and reducing stress and anxiety. However we only produce CBD internally on demand, so by supplementing the levels of our own naturally occurring CBD, we can encourage balance in our body, more often, which helps to quieten internal stressors or triggers that result in stress or distraction. </p>\r\n<p>I personally found that once I started taking CBD regularly  it felt like a newfound sense of clarity and calm. Initially I took <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/\">CBD Oil</a> in droplet form like our <a href=\"/oto-sleep-drops.html\">OTO Sleep Drops	&trade;</a>, but now my favourite way to get my daily dosage is through use of our <a href=\"/shop/cbd-skincare.html\">rich and moisturising body oils</a> and a few dashes of our <a href=\"/oto-cbd-bitters.html\">CBD Bitters</a> in my coffee in the morning. It lets me focus and prioritise, and almost more importantly, to recognise the irrationality of some of the thoughts I would previously have over-analysed and stressed about. With CBD I don’t waste time cataloging the reasons I am anxious - instead when I choose to take some time to myself, I am actually taking time to myself. And what a relief that is. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Gemma<br>\r\n(OTO Founder)</p>','2020-08-14 13:53:07','2020-11-27 08:11:54','2020-08-14 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/how-cbd-helps-me-relax.jpg','How can CBD help me relax',1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'YItVGqgZCN63C3QWqLhIaLm0hxbIK8Ei',0,NULL,'OTO founder Gemma Colao shares her CBD rituals that help her relax',NULL),(45,'Raising the bar with our brand new botanical seltzers',NULL,NULL,NULL,'raising-the-bar-with-our-brand-new-botanical-seltzers',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p><b>OTO drinks director, Tom Lorimer, talks about our brand new OTO CBD Botanical Seltzers and why you should be excited too…</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As OTO’s drinks director it may come as no surprise that I do enjoy the occasional tipple. But with ever growing concerns over alcohol consumption and a demand for healthier alternatives I find daily satisfaction in working for a brand that’s part of the solution. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s why I’m so pleased to share with you the exciting launch of our brand new CBD Botanical Seltzers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>A GROWING MARKET FOR LOW AND NO ALCOHOL</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it\'s been the meteoric rise of Seedlip and other alcohol-free spirits or the opening of BrewDog’s first alcohol-free bar, the ‘nolo’ market for alcohol alternatives is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/20/uk-brewers-invest-in-low-alcohol-drinks-trend\">on the up-and-up</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trend is well-documented and we have seen no and low alcohol products come to market for several years now. At OTO, we always knew this was a space we wanted to be part of. Indeed, CBD is also a great alternative to alcohol as it can help contribute to relaxing and unwinding, whilst feeling more present and in the moment. Whether it’s celebrating the start of the weekend with that Friday evening cocktail or bringing drinks along to a BBQ, we wanted to develop the best CBD drinks out there for all occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve had superb traction with our halo product - the world’s first <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/oto-cbd-bitters.html\">CBD Bitters</a> - which not only delivers a rich, floral and zesty flavour boost for cocktails, but also provides an impressive 20mg of CBD in just a few dashes. And at £79 for a bottle and lasting over 100 serves, it’s no wonder that it’s become one of our best-selling OTO products yet.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THE BAR FOR CBD DRINKS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Off the back of our OTO Bitters’ booming trade and consumer following, we knew there was so much more we could still do with <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/\">CBD Oil</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the market was getting crowded with on-the-go CBD infused soft drinks, we saw an opportunity to keep raising the bar. You see, our mission at OTO from the start has always been to ‘design thoughtful and effective products that easily and enjoyably fit into your daily lives’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So our product director, Dr Ketan Joshi, started tinkering away in the OTO lab to bring you the best CBD infused sparkling water...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<b>When developing all our products, but specifically the seltzers, we tick the five OTO boxes of sight, smell, flavour, experience and after-taste. Each of the range brings all these together to deliver a truly game-changing product.</b>” Dr Ketan Joshi</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s taken months of work and product development from the whole team to launch not one, but three new drinks, within the backdrop of partial lockdown and remote working. I’m so proud of the team. What a result! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if the flavour wasn’t enough, here is why we are excited with these incredible Botanical Seltzers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\";font-weight:bold;padding-left:3rem\"><li>there is an OTOStrength&trade; measure of 25mg of pure CBD per can, so you can enjoy up to 3 a day</li>\r\n<li>they are made entirely with 100% natural Ayurvedic botanical extracts</li>\r\n<li>we worked hard to avoid any artificial flavours or preservatives</li>\r\n<li>they’re also completely guilt-free with absolutely zero sugar</li></ul>\r\n \r\n\r\n<h2>SO WHAT DO THEY TASTE LIKE?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Available in 3 carefully and thoughtfully designed flavours, our new CBD Botanical Seltzers are very much a sophisticated, adult drink. We blended only the best botanicals to achieve subtle yet complex flavour profiles, great to sip ice-cold or experiment with when mixing ‘mindful’ cocktails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all of our OTO products, we combined the highest quality natural ingredients and adaptogens to complement our OTOStrength&trade; pure CBD to fit different moods and moments throughout the day:</p>\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/cbd-seltzer-cans-1080.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"CBD Botanical Seltzers\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>FOCUS CBD BOTANICAL SELTZER</h3>\r\n<p>For centering your thoughts and bringing the day into FOCUS</p>\r\n<p>With a light yet revitalising blend of wild Korean sencha tea, fresh mint and kampot pepper spice</p>\r\n<h3>AMPLIFY CBD BOTANICAL SELTZER</h3>\r\n<p>AMPLIFY shared moments to feel brighter, more alert and fully energised...</p>\r\n<p>With the subtle fruit flavours of bitter orange and goji berry, blended with the gentle heat of hand-picked habanero chillies.</p>\r\n<h3>BALANCE CBD BOTANICAL SELTZER</h3>\r\n<p>Bring BALANCE to your day when needed...</p>\r\n<p>With the soothing, sweet and refreshing combination of English elderflower, fresh cucumber and a hint of liquorice.</p>\r\n<img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/discovery-pack-1080.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"CBD Botanical Seltzers discovery pack\" />\r\n<p>Not sure which one you prefer?

After almost a year of research, planning and design, I\'m so excited to say that today we have launched our brand new <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-skincare\">RITUAL CBD day skincare range</a> - the most potent and effective CBD skincare range around. Combining the power of OTOStrength™ CBD and specially selected hand picked ayurvedic botanicals, this new range of skincare will change how you take care of your skin this winter.</p>\r\n<p>When we started working on the <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-skincare\">RITUAL range</a>, I couldn\'t have predicted just how important it would be. Certainly there was no such thing as \'lockdown face\'... which some claim adds up to 10 years in age (eek)! The complete upheaval of all our routines, comforts and habits has wreaked havoc with our brains and bodies. More of us than usual have been struggling with anxiety, often leading to trouble sleeping at night. Combine that with months on end sitting at home staring at screens - no wonder our skin is feeling stressed and tired too! We can do something about that.</p>\r\n<p>OTO exists to help people discover the power of CBD. Not only to help with stress and anxiety, but for your skin too. The new <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-skincare\">RITUAL CBD SKINCARE range</a> is exactly what we need right now.</p>\r\n<h2>COMING BACK TO WORK</h2>\r\n<p>Whether you’re at home, at the office or somewhere in between, everyone’s been through quite a bit of change this year. On my end, I’ve only just come back from maternity leave. So going from sleepless nights and changing nappies to Zoom calls, Trello boards, creative briefs and photoshoots has been interesting to say the least! I can’t say I haven’t felt pretty tired and down at times. And don’t get me started on post pregnancy, hormonal acne (or was that just my lockdown face?!).</p>\r\n<p>Of course, that’s until we finalised the secret samples of our new <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-skincare\"> RITUAL range.</a></p>\r\n<h2>CBD FOR SKIN</h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/oto-skincare-face.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"CBD Skincare\"></p>\r\n<p>With so many external and internal stressors affecting the health of our skin, investing in the right skincare routine is something I am particularly passionate about. We’d already launched our <a>BALANCE night time skincare range</a> last year, packed with very potent quantities of CBD and the best botanicals to help your skin repair and restore overnight. It’s luxurious and indulgent - I like to say it’s your ‘beauty sleep’ in a jar! And it’s been taking over the socials after it helped OTO win Best Brand For Skincare at the Hip and Healthy CBD Awards 2020:</p>\r\n<p><em>\' Not only do <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/cbd-skincare.html\">OTO’s range of skincare products</a> help to repair the skin and prevent signs of ageing, but they also have a large focus on overall wellbeing.

And whilst our BALANCE range was helping it restore overnight, we wanted products to help protect, soothe and rejuvenate skin during the day too.</p>\r\n<p>And that is exactly what our new RITUAL range was designed to do.</p>\r\n<p>Featuring a <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-serum.html\">Serum</a>, a <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-day-cream.html\">Day Cream</a> and a <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-lip-balm.html\">Lip Balm</a>, this potent new range is designed to help rebalance and protect all skin types, and in turn help improve various skin concerns from acne to eczema.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/focus-ritual-range1080.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"Ritual CBD Skincare\"></p>\r\n<p>We want to empower everyone to feel great in their natural skin.

When thinking about what it means to be mindful about our health, for me, its impossible for that to not centre around sleep. Sleep isn’t just about feeling less tired; its the foundation upon which our bodies regulate everything from mood to skin health, to overall cognition.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">If we’re not getting enough quality, uninterrupted sleep then everything else in our lives is affected. With a reported 63% of the population sleeping worse in 2020, it comes as no surprise that our <strong><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/oto-cbd-sleep-drops\">CBD Sleep Drops</a></strong> are our best-selling product.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In this gift set, you’ll find a bottle of our signature drops along with a mini <strong><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/cbd-skincare/cbd-night-face-mask.html\">CBD Night Face Mask</a></strong> and exclusive OTO Silk Eye Mask.

After launching our <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/journal/post/embracebareface-staying-positive-and-glowing-amidst-uncertainty\">#embracebareface campaign</a> alongside the release of our <strong><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-skincare\">RITUAL CBD Skin Care</a></strong> range, it wouldn’t feel right talking about Mindfulness this Christmas without a set dedicated to keeping your skin looking its best; giving you the confidence to be glowing from the inside out.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">On the back of successfully launching our Balance Skin Care range, which was designed to replenish and rejuvenate throughout the <em>night</em>, our Ritual range picks up where Balance left off with a trio of products that protect and revitalise your skin throughout the <em>day. </em>Our <strong><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/ritual-cbd-serum.html\">Ritual CBD Serum</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/ritual-cbd-day-cream.html\">Day Cream</a></strong> work in tandem to both shield and heal your skin, whatever your skin-type.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">You’ll find both in this gorgeous gift set alongside the <strong><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/ritual-cbd-lip-balm.html\">Ritual CBD Lip Balm</a></strong>. Together they represent the perfect gesture for showing that you care for protecting your loved ones skin; allowing them to feel at peace in their natural glowing exterior.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/GOGS_1080x708.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"Gift of Glowing Skin Set\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">I couldn’t be prouder of all the work that is going on at OTO. Whilst times are especially challenging, each and every member of the team is working hard to continue to innovate and refine the highest quality CBD experience for our customers, with this Christmas range being the perfect example.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course we all wish there wasn’t the pressing need to cope with anxiety and stress right now, but for me personally this Christmas period will be about making sure myself and my loved ones are being kind to ourselves.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Our health and wellbeing is ultimately always the most important thing in life, and regardless of this year’s peculiarities, the opportunity is still there to re-centre, re-focus, and tune in to what really matters. We hope you enjoy gifting the power of <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/\">CBD Oil</a> this Christmas, and I can’t wait to see what you guys think of the range.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">From all at OTO, we wish you a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Keep well,</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Gemma x</p>','2020-11-05 11:35:17','2020-11-27 07:45:48','2020-11-05 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/blog-header_1.jpg','OTO CBD Gift of Glowing Skin Set',15,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'zxRGGZErX2brIZH2qw5o4vFmc4mek9B3',0,NULL,'Introducing our CBD Christmas Gift Range.',NULL),(53,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>This is a test</p>\r\n<p>This another test</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pillow-mist-m.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"test\"></p>\r\n<h2>Headline 2</h2>\r\n<p>More text here</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>here is <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/cbd-night-face-cream.html\">some text</a></p>','2020-11-05 11:44:46','2020-11-05 11:50:23','2020-11-05 00:00:00',0,1,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'JOguHnI4Oy96p62muUYN1CH7M7zCGlnS',0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(54,'#embracebareface with Emma Hoareau (Duplicated with Suggested Improvements)',NULL,NULL,NULL,'embracebareface-with-skincare-expert-emma-hoareau',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>I’m all for bare, real skin so I’m thrilled to be a part of the #EmbraceBareFace campaign with OTO.

I know how much my body and I love my nightly sleep drops, but my sensitive, breakout prone skin is ideal for CBD skincare too as it helps to reduce inflammation (aka acne, sensitivity and redness), balance oil production and encourages repair. To me, healthy skin is happy skin and that is what you get with OTO.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>MORNING ROUTINE WITH RITUAL</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The Ritual products are full of antioxidant ingredients to help protect the skin throughout the day from free radicals such as pollution and smoke. I’ve been using the Ritual CBD Serum which is a wonderful texture; it adds immediate hydration and glow, and uses Pomegranate Oil – a rich antioxidant –<span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:montserratMedium\"> to protect my skin</span> from anything that comes its way. I\'ve complemented&nbsp;this with the Ritual CBD Day Cream to lock in the goodness thanks to its healthy amount of Baobab oil, full of protective omega fatty acids.

Establishing a Morning Routine</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Put the time you save on commuting to good use</strong>.<br>&nbsp;<br>Through creating more time for yourself in the mornings, you can make smarter, more informed decisions from a place of balance. Making a moment to think about <strong>positive affirmations, gratitudes and intentions is a great way&nbsp;to bring extra momentum and energy to the start of your day.</strong><br><br>Personally, I like to put on a high-vibe, upbeat track and move my body first thing to get into a positive mood for the day.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Calming Down Your Mind</h2>\r\n<p>I know what you\'re thinking... easier said than done!<br><br>Well,&nbsp;<strong>did you know that writing down your thoughts is a great way to improve your emotional health?</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Journaling has been proven to reduce stress, keep memory sharp, boost mood and strengthen emotional functions.</p>\r\n<p>During lockdown, it can be more difficult to find the time to confide in friends. That\'s why ‘mind-dumping’ can be a useful tool to process your anxieties and tune into your emotions; allowing you to<strong> Find Your Space.</strong></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/writer-writing-ss-1920.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>4. Cutting Down on Alcohol</strong></h2>\r\n<p>With over 25% of drinkers claiming to have upped their alcohol in-take over the first lockdown period, it\'s imporant to be mindful of our drinking habits.</p>\r\n<p>Whilst the odd&nbsp;glass of wine can help us unwind and relax, regular consumption can actually be counter-productive for managing stress and anxiety.</p>\r\n<p>After all, <strong>alcohol is a chemical depressant</strong>. It disrupts the delicate balance of chemicals and processes in our brain, affecting our thoughts, feelings and actions,&nbsp;often to the detriment of our long-term mental health.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Have you tried our new CBD Botanical Seltzers?</strong>&nbsp;<strong><br><br></strong>Each can of&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-botanical-seltzers?utm_source=Unknown+List&amp;utm_campaign=fa5716ef71-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_04_11_43&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-fa5716ef71-&amp;mc_cid=fa5716ef71&amp;mc_eid=[UNIQID]\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://otocbd.com/cbd-botanical-seltzers?utm_source%3DUnknown%2BList%26utm_campaign%3Dfa5716ef71-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_04_11_43%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_term%3D0_-fa5716ef71-%26mc_cid%3Dfa5716ef71%26mc_eid%3D%5BUNIQID%5D&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605031729655000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEW6zty-OdZrdKX4v_JAWlICRgbxg\">our delicious seltzers</a></strong> contain <strong>25mg&nbsp;of pure CBD</strong>, as well as <strong>ZERO sugar.&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>They also contain only the highest quality functional botanicals, used for centuries because of their health benefits related to alleviating stress and anxiety.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/1_flat_lay.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h2>5.

But good sleep is bloody hard to come by!</p>\r\n<p>So when we released our brand new OTO CBD Sleep Drops just over a month ago, the whole team was immensely proud. Somehow under complete lockdown and with everyone working remotely we managed to launch the most innovative CBD tincture on the market - which would have been a feat even under the best of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">circumstances.</a></p>\r\n<p>This has been a long time in the making. Our mission is to encourage people to discover the power of CBD, by creating thoughtful and effective products that easily and enjoyably fit into their daily lives. In order to stay true to our mission, we knew that we could not ignore one of the largest segments of the CBD market, but we had the very real ambition to develop something that represented true innovation within the drops/tincture category. The whole team has worked incredibly hard over the last 8 months to develop the best tincture money can buy - and now it’s here.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic;\">‘Given the challenging circumstances of bringing this product to life, I have to say it’s the one I’m most proud of’. - Rina Bhansali, Production Director, OTO</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic;\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/alex-loup-4N5huJDOydQ-unsplash_2.JPG&quot;}}\" alt=\"Hand holding leaf\"></p>\r\n<p>The drops became a bedtime essential for the whole team. It’s safe to say that we were all relieved to finally be catching up on some much-needed sleep, as we had all been struggling a little more than usual but weren’t quite sure why.</p>\r\n<p>The next week t<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52911395\">his BBC article</a> landed, highlighting the concerning result of their latest sleep survey:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52911395\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/bbc-4.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"More than half the UK population has struggled with sleep during the lockdown\"></a></p>\r\n<!--<p style=\"font-weight:bold\">\"More than half the UK population has struggled with sleep during the lockdown\" </p>-->\r\n<p>That was when the penny really dropped. Not only had we just launched a market-leading product, but we had done so in time to answer a very real, new and pressing consumer need. Now, more people than ever need support to take care of their minds and bodies, and ultimately achieve their vital daily requirement of a good night’s sleep.</p>\r\n<p>Sleep is essential to our health. For the body and mind to restore and regenerate. Having been someone who has struggled with sleep a lot throughout my life, it is undeniable how much of an impact a good night’s sleep has on my overall wellbeing. It helps you feel positive, refreshed, reinvigorated and ready to take on the day with all the energy and confidence you deserve. You cannot reach your full potential without sleep, that’s why it represents one of the key cornerstones of our product range at OTO.</p>\r\n<p>After the success of our now award-winning Pillow Mist - used by the lovely Cressida Bonas and Jodie Kidd no less - we knew we needed to broaden out our Sleep range. First we developed our incredible range of Night-time Skincare. This range contains the highest concentrations of CBD within the global skincare market, and works with your body to regenerate, renew and repair your skin whilst you sleep. This range is now loved by skincare enthusiasts across the UK and to truly complete our Sleep range, we wanted to tackle a drop.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/cressiada-quote-2.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>When looking at drops and tinctures, it can’t be denied that most of them are quite unpleasant to use, often tasting quite bitter and grassy. It can also be quite challenging to get the dosage right; and the last thing you want before going to bed is to have to worry about counting drops or measuring mls.</p>\r\n<p>There are four main reasons why people really do love our Sleep Drops:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>They taste amazing. </strong>We spent a lot of time getting the taste and flavour profile perfect. We were keen to make the product light and refreshing, with a combination of the highest quality 100% natural coconut, lavender, liquorice and field mint extracts. You really get a delicious and subtle minty flavour, which is perfect to easily fit into your bedtime routine, e.g after brushing your teeth.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The unique product elements make it the easiest tincture to use.</strong>Going to bed needs to be as stress-free as possible and so using our Sleep Drops needed to be too. So much love, care and effort went into designing our bottle; and the result is that it delivers the exact dose you need to start drifting away - at the simple click of a button.</li>\r\n<li><strong>They really do work. </strong>Like all of our OTO products, our Sleep Drops come with our OTOStrength guarantee of optimum and truly effective levels of the highest quality, pure CBD isolate. With 10% CBD and a complementary blend of organic, hand- picked botanical extracts like lavender and butterfly pea flower, these ingredients were specially selected to help you wind down and relax for bedtime. <br><br>I was absolutely stunned when our customer trial results came back. They were even better than expected, especially given the rigorous approach we took. My favourite stat… trialists reporting ‘Very good’ or ‘Good’ overall sleep quality went from 8% before Sleep Drops usage to 62% at the end of the trial. That’s an <strong>8x increase </strong>in people getting Good to Very Good sleep using our product! <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">‘I loved it and have been raving to all my friends about them. I\'m so pleased that my hunch <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/amplify-cbd-body-oil-1.html\">CBD oil</a> might be a way to improve my sleep issues.

Highest-quality, pure CBD isolate which is both safe and effective to use, as well as our hand-picked and organic ayurvedic botanical extracts, are expensive raw ingredients to source. But we are on a mission to help people discover the power of CBD. And as we have grown, we’ve managed to find some savings along the way, recently reducing our prices to pass those savings on to the customer.

Get rid of perfume soap, instead try washing with a moisturising cream. The golden rule is to avoid anything that lathers; bubbles are bad for your skin.</p>\r\n<p>2. Apply moisturiser right after washing your hands, whilst they are still moist, to help lock in the water. We recommend our brand new <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/ritual-cbd-hand-balm.html\">RITUAL CBD Hand Balm</a>, packed with pure CBD and functional botanicals to help soothe and protect your hands - repeat hand washing, cold weather and all!<br><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/hand-band-lady-watch.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"Lady Applying Hand Balm\"  ></p>\r\n<p>3.

Because&nbsp;it\'s never too late to add new traditions into the mix, we hope to&nbsp;give you some fresh inspiration, or at least&nbsp;some re-arrurance that Christmas traditions come in all sorts of&nbsp;weird, wacky and wonderful forms!</span></p>\r\n<p>There are certain&nbsp;aspects of Christmas that every family can relate to. From decorating the Christmas tree to the mandatory overindulgence&nbsp;on Quality Street. The petty squabbles over the remote control to the competitive game of charades. However, it is the variation between homes that makes Christmas traditions such a meaningful part of our identity and belonging. The team at OTO explore their favourite Christmas traditions and what makes them so special.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Pre-Christmas Traditions</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain members of our team’s most prominent traditions centre around the build up to Christmas as opposed to the day itself; <strong>Hannah\'s&nbsp;(partner from Moxeys Mints)</strong>&nbsp;tradition is going to Neal\'s yard dairy cheese mongers in Covent Garden on the 22nd December. Her 11-year-old daughter enjoys the particularly potent cheeses. They always buy too much and come out stuffed at 8:30am but it’s their \'</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stinking</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tradition\' and they love it.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/hannah.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h3><strong>A Time for the Whole Family</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know Christmas is a time for family, I mean the</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> whole </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">family, in <strong>Scotty\'s</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Account Executive)&nbsp;</strong>home,&nbsp;no man (or dog) is left behind. Their golden retriever, Frank, is served his very own roast with all the trimmings!</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Laid-Back Christmases</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some families enjoy the glitz&nbsp;and glam of an extravagant day, other families, such as the Ross\' and the&nbsp;Joshi’s, prefer to hang out in comfy pyjamas, succumb to their food coma and fall into a Christmas movie marathon. <strong>Gabe\'s</strong> <strong>(Account Executive)</strong>&nbsp;family open presents in the morning then&nbsp;head to the pub to see their wider relations, before heading home for a huge&nbsp;lunch &amp; inevitable afternoon kip.&nbsp;<strong>Dev</strong> <strong>(Product Development, Operations and all-round&nbsp;Logistics super-star)&nbsp;</strong>describes a typical Christmas at home as a huge lunch followed by a sluggish post-food-binge walk, before falling asleep to Wallace and Gromit to close out the day - \"Dad\'s off before the opening credits end!\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/Dev_Christmas_1080x708.PNG.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Competitive Christmases</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Sienna\'s (Marketing Executive)</strong>&nbsp;family fall into the&nbsp;competitive Christmas category, seeing who can wear their Christmas cracker crown the longest. Most of the paper crowns stay on through the nights, and come Boxing Day morning, look as dishevelled as the whole family feel! There’s nothing quite like a bit of family rivalry. The ruthless giant jingo games in <strong>Gemma\'s&nbsp;(Founder and Creative Director)</strong>&nbsp;household usually end in injuries thanks to her uncle\'s elaborate moves!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Traditional Christmases</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, some members of our team reminisce on the more traditional aspects of Christmas. Each year, <strong>Lucile, (Head of Growth)</strong>&nbsp;and her brother&nbsp;</span>recreate the same photo putting up the Christmas tree decorations, whilst wearing Santa Hats with carols blaring in the background.&nbsp;<strong>Ale (Creative Designer)</strong>&nbsp;loves watching Home Alone with her sister on Christmas Eve, while <strong>Rachel (Account Executive)</strong>&nbsp;enjoys a hot chocolate with her family. <strong>Helen (Head of Spa)</strong>&nbsp;relishes in the gift giving aspect of Christmas, creating a Christmas Eve box for her daughter with her new pyjamas, a Christmas film, some hot chocolate &amp; one present to open.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/xmas-4.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Quirky Christmases</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Gemma’s</strong> Christmas traditions are slightly more distinctive. Gemma spends her Christmas Eve carol signing, drinking rubbish mulled wine and eating lasagna at&nbsp;her Mum and Dad’s. Her Christmas Day involves themed decorations - last year it was Dinosaurs! Whilst Gemma’s decorative skills are ‘epic’, she steers clear of the kitchen, leaving her mum and sister to the cauliflower cheese, while she concentrates on making mulled wine;&nbsp;a recipe she honed during her years spent living in Germany.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Influenced by his Spanish heritage,&nbsp;<strong>Nigel\'s (OTO\'s&nbsp;Tech Wiz)</strong>&nbsp;Christmas Eve dinner consists of fish-based delicacies.&nbsp;On Christmas day Nigel\'s&nbsp;family&nbsp;and other families congregate at one&nbsp;of their houses for a Christmas carol sing along accompanied by bucks fizz and some nibbles.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Christmases a&nbsp;Long Way&nbsp;from Home</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the rare occasion that we travel away for Christmas, in true ‘Brits abroad’ fashion, we tend to&nbsp;take our traditions with us and risk sticking out like a sore thumb.&nbsp;A certain member of our team, not naming and shaming, <strong>(Scotty)</strong>, is the poster child for this. Contrarily, <strong>James (CEO)</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Michael (OTO\'s Scientist)</strong>&nbsp;have had to readjust and embrace new traditions. Their Christmas’ growing up in Australia consisted of prawns with 1000 island dressing, backyard cricket and days spent in the pool. More recently, they have had to connect with their families over Skype. James has had no problem adopting one British tradition; the Christmas jumper. \"He has built up a collection of 8 jumpers...&nbsp; long before it was on trend or even OK - full on Mr Darcy action\" Gemma mocks.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/Christmas_2_1080x708.PNG_1.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Scented&nbsp;Christmases</strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the festive season, smells, sounds and sights evoke memories and feelings that reconnect us with our past. For <strong>Celine (Digital Designer)</strong>,&nbsp;the smell of chestnuts reminds her of her childhood Christmases with her uncle warming them in his chimney fire. Every year her family buy and share chestnuts together at the Christmas market.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Boozy Christmases</strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong>Tom, OTO\'s&nbsp;cocktail connoisseur\'s and Drink\'s Director,</strong>&nbsp;enjoys making his ultimate Christmas cocktail for his whole family to enjoy, and he has shared his recipe with us!</p>\r\n<p>A Pomegranate and Vermouth Mulled Wine</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-left:1rem\">\r\n<li>500ml Pomegranate Juice</li>\r\n<li>100ml Vermouth</li>\r\n<li>200ml Red Wine</li>\r\n<li>Heated and mixed with thinly sliced oranges, cinnamon sticks, honey, cloves and allspice berries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/Tom_Christmas_1_1080x708.PNG.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\r\n<p>We wish you a Merry Christmas x</p>','2020-11-23 15:24:33','2020-11-26 12:14:08','2020-11-23 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/pexels-freestocksorg2-1080x7202.jpg','Christmas Decorations',16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'PtWuhgqxeQT4I4qNAGtThCY5jlF5LdX4',0,NULL,'Our team explore their favourite Christmas traditions',NULL),(61,'non',NULL,NULL,NULL,'non',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2020-11-24 16:47:16','2020-11-25 18:02:48','2020-11-24 00:00:00',0,1,0,NULL,NULL,16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(62,'A Merry, Mindful Christmas',NULL,NULL,NULL,'a-merry-mindful-christmas',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>This Christmas is one for embracing and appreciating the little things.

As much as we wish to ignore our stressors or pretend they don’t exist, the truth is we can’t because we cannot control the world around us. Where meditation comes in handy is that we are not aiming to eliminate our stressors or anxious thoughts but to engage with&nbsp;them differently. <strong>Between stimulus and response there is space. In that space is the power to choose our responses.</strong> Meditation helps us observe those mind traps that play a role in your stress and your reaction to stress. In my opinion everyone should be meditating in this day and age and reaping the benefits but sometimes it can be misinterpreted, seen as boring or too hard. <strong>Research shows that you can improve mood, promote optimism and lower stress responses.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-maksim-goncharenok-4348589_3_.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></h3>\r\n<h3><strong>Whats the problem?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>When I speak to people about meditating they usually say they are ‘bad’ at it or simply can’t shut their thoughts off, which is what a lot of people believe meditation is: blocking out all thoughts and being blank. Some people find it boring or don’t know if it’s working. Others say they fall asleep and ask how they can stay awake. I want to share what I’m currently learning in teacher training at The British School of Meditation and make meditation accessible and easy for everyone starting from today.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-samuel-silitonga-737586.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h3><strong>It’s important to go through what meditation is not:</strong></h3>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;Mediation is not sitting on the top of the Himalayas humming and chanting for 12 hours. <br>-&nbsp;Meditation shouldn’t be seen as something you only do if you have copious amounts of time. <br>-&nbsp;Meditation isn’t shutting down your brain and blocking out your thoughts.<br>-&nbsp;Meditation isn’t a quick fix, it’s not instant and it is never completed, that’s why its called a practise. <br>-&nbsp;Meditation isn’t linked to a certain stereotype.<br>-&nbsp;Meditation isn’t attached to religious beliefs.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-pixabay-268020_3_.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Now let\'s talk about what meditation is:</strong></h3>\r\n<p>- Meditation is being in the here and now not worrying about the past or the future, accepting where you are without judgement.<br>-&nbsp;Meditation is paying attention to your thoughts without engaging in them or judging them.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>And what meditation means to me:</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Meditation for me is going inwards connecting to myself on a deeper level in the present moment surrendering my need to be in the future letting thoughts come and go as they please but being aware of them and not getting lost in their stories. For me, it’s a chance to visualise myself in the sky floating amongst&nbsp;the fluffy clouds not rearing off into a cloud of thought just gently brushing it as I go by. Meditation is an opportunity to check in with my body every single day and practise self-love and kindness that makes me calm, present and happier.</p>\r\n<h3><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/jay-castor-7AcMUSYRZpU-unsplash.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"><br><strong>3 Tips on how to get started:</strong></h3>\r\n<p>If you want to learn meditation, it’s good to just begin, right now, without hesitating. You don’t need to wait until you’re ‘ready’. In every moment you are ready.</p>\r\n<p><strong>’To begin, begin.’ - William Wordsworth</strong></p>\r\n<h3><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-pixabay-268134.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></h3>\r\n<h3><strong>1. Identify your spot!</strong></h3>\r\n<p>First thing\'s first, it’s important you assign yourself a space where you’ll be arriving at each day to sit for your practise. Don’t overcomplicate this space, it can be a space on the floor in your bedroom where you sit crosslegged with your back against the bed. The ideal place would be somewhere that is quiet in a corner of a room, with the corner behind you, which will provide a sense of security. Make sure the room isn’t too hot so you don’t become sleepy. Nice touches can be to light a candle&nbsp;or roll-on some OTO <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/oto-focus-20-percent-cbd-essential-oil.html\">Focus CBD oil</a> to kick off the practise.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-pixabay-45178.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h3><strong>2. How do I sit?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>It can depend on what meditation you are practising but posture is really important because the body and mind are linked. Traditional position is to sit crosslegged on the floor. You can do this by sitting on a cushion or on a chair. Wherever you wish to sit, it\'s important your back is straight and you are not leaning against the chair. Meditation can be done lying down but I only recommend this when you’re doing a sleep meditation or a bodyscan. If you are sitting on a firm chair your feet should be parallel and your hands should be placed on your lap resting with the palms facing up which is an open posture that enhances listening. When palms are turned down this can be to feel more grounded and go more inwards. I decide before my practise what I feel like I need more of when it comes to how my hands are placed. Neck should be lengthened and face should be relaxed.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-lucas-pezeta-2035066.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>3. What meditation should I choose?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Did you know that there are up to 10 different types of meditations which I encourage people to really explore when they begin meditating. Many people I speak to only know about simple guided breathing meditation. That’s why I\'m a huge fan of the app Insight Timer which helped me find my style that brings me back into the present moment.</p>\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">In part 2, I have given my top 4 different types and where to find them!</div>\r\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>','2020-12-04 17:15:03','2020-12-19 14:11:47','2020-12-04 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/Image_from_iOS_53_.jpg',NULL,16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'hTLJVljCp3pc2IXCAX4rBSerlnXEyTrD',0,NULL,'Milla Lascles, a member of the UK Health Coaches Association, shares how meditation has kept her calm, rational and present during this pandemic - and it’s all backed up by science!

By bringing your body back into balance, CBD can help you radiate confidence and beauty from within. It is an incredibly versatile ingredient that when applied topically, or ingested orally, can help with both dry and oily skin, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and calming inflammation.</p>\r\n<p>At OTO, we pride ourselves in bringing clarity and understanding to the CBD market by continuing to share our ever expanding knowledge and findings on this wonder molecule. So to keep to our mission, we asked you to send in your questions about CBD and skincare; OTO\'s very own scientist and all-round CBD boffin, Dr Michael Haslam, author of The CBD Journey, is here to answer them!<a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-skincare\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/skincare_1080x1000.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Why is CBD used in skincare?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Stress and anxiety, perhaps the prevailing health issues in our society today, often manifest in the appearance of our skin, sometimes creating pain and inflammation. CBD has a myriad of benefits, both inside and out that help deal with these symptoms. CBD is highly ‘sebostatic’. This means that it reacts with receptors to help balance sebum (skin oil) synthesis, which leads to fewer impurities like pimples, spots or blackheads. But it doesn’t just strip away oils: it will actually increase oil production in dry skin, depending on what your body needs making it great for all skin types. Since it acts across a variety of receptors, CBD is also able to promote collagen growth, reduce chronic inflammation, bond with free radicals (limiting their potential to cause DNA damage), and enhance the effectiveness of other skincare products.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>‘It has reduced oiliness in my skin but kept it hydrated. I loved how hydrated my skin was the next day’. Georgina Y</strong></em></p>\r\n<h3><strong>What is CBD?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>CBD stands for cannabidiol, a completely natural compound derived from the hemp plant. Unlike its counterpart—THC—CBD is non-intoxicating and has been declared safe by the World Health Organisation.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/ritual-cbd-hand-balm.html\"><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/hand_balm_1080x1000.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>How does CBD react with the human body?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Our bodies produce very similar molecules to CBD on their own, known as endogenous cannabinoids. All cannabinoids, whether produced by the body or extracted from the hemp plant, react with a network of receptors found in the body, known as the Human Endocannabinoid system (HES). The cannabinoids found in CBD act as messengers to other receptors that help manage pain, inflammation, muscle control, and more.</p>\r\n<p>The HES is responsible for creating homeostasis - or balance - within the body, as well as helping to regulate physiological functions such as our natural sleep cycle. Cannabinoids are made by our body on demand and are not stored or constant: often levels can deplete. By supplementing our natural cannabinoids with plant-based CBD, it can help restore fine-scale balance (homeostasis) within the body...</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/ritual-cbd-day-cream.html\"><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/day_cream_1080x1000.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Does CBD affect people differently depending on their individual needs?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>On a day-to-day basis our skin is affected by a variety of both external irritants, such as harsh weather and pollution, and internal changes, like fluctuations in hormones, stress levels and sleep. CBD brings our body back into balance as we constantly face modern challenges that threaten to disturb our natural recovery pattern.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, CBD has been shown in pre-clinical trials to aid with conditions such as dry skin or overactive skin oil production. CBD is not a cure for these conditions, but nudges the body towards a healthy state. By adding CBD regularly to your skin, you are building up a protective layer that doesn’t just help reduce problems, it can act to prevent them occurring in the first place.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>‘This product is game changing! I noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin within 3 days, it felt so hydrated and youthful. The sore ezcema patches in the creases of my eyelids disappeared’. Shen Y</strong></em></p>\r\n<h1><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/fleur-kaan-w4Dj3MshHQ0-unsplash_1.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></h1>\r\n<h3><strong>How effective are CBD\'s anxiety-relieving benefits in skincare?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>When applied topically, CBD is absorbed through the tough top layer of the skin, the epidermis, and stays in the underlying dermis as a reservoir for when it is needed. Only a very small amount of the CBD filters through into your bloodstream. Therefore, generally CBD in skincare does not have the potent anxiety-relieving benefits that it is capable of when ingested.</p>\r\n<p>However, at OTO we combine CBD in skincare with hand picked Ayurvedic botanicals and terpenes chosen for their functional benefits and scents. These essential oil extracts enhance your wellbeing through stimulating your senses. Some terpenes also help CBD move more easily through the epidermis, so you should always look for products with those ingredients.</p>\r\n<p>Our OTO <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/cbd-roll-ons.html\">roll-on oils</a> for example have been specifically designed to be applied to your temples and wrists, where your skin is the thinnest and your blood supply is closest to the surface, enhancing their soothing capacity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>‘The scent makes me feel calm, relaxed and sleep-inducing’</strong> <strong>Amy S</strong></em></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/ritual-cbd-lip-balm.html\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/lip_balm_1080x1000.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>Why is CBD a useful ingredient in anti-ageing skincare?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>As we age, the rate of our skin cell regeneration slows down, our skin loses its elasticity and fine lines become more prominent. CBD is beneficial because it triggers apoptosis (natural cell death) in our older skin cells, supporting our skin renewal process. CBD has powerful antioxidant benefits through bonding with free radicals—literally free oxygen and other atoms that float around our body interfering with natural processes—therefore protecting our skin against external stressors such as UV rays and pollution.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>‘Plumper, smoother skin’ Julia W</strong></em></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://otocbd.com/cbd-ritual-skincare\"><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/serum_and_day_cream_1080x1000.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></a></p>\r\n<h3><strong>How much CBD should I be using in my skincare routine?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>You will not experience any harmful effects from using too much CBD in your skincare routine. Our body naturally removes excess CBD. However, we recommend an optimum daily dose of between 40-60mg of CBD. This dose, which we term OTOStrength, ensures that the reservoir of CBD in your skin doesn’t run dry, keeping you and your skin feeling happy, protected and ready to take on any busy day!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','2020-12-08 17:01:50','2020-12-09 15:12:42','2020-12-08 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/lifestyle_skincare_1080x708.jpg','Smiling Face applying skincare',16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'yyX96f3Z53MNGUzIxfnMzdCdrhptryun',0,NULL,'OTO\'s very own scientist answers all your CBD skincare queries',NULL),(65,'Understanding Mindfulness with expert Alice Law',NULL,NULL,NULL,'embracing-mindfulness',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<h2><a href=\"https://www.lawali-life.com/\">Alice Law</a>,&nbsp;Stress Management &amp; Holistic Performance Coach, Reiki &amp; Mindfulness Practitioner, has shared with us her expert understanding of how to live mindfully.</h2>\r\n<h3>Mindfulness is the art of paying attention to what is going on in the present moment, with kindness.</h3>\r\n<p>But, what does that actually entail and how can we incorporate that into our day to day lives?</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/Layer_1_1_.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>The concept of mindfulness is something that has really grown in trend over the past 10 years, due to its ability to decrease our stress levels and make us feel more at peace and present.</p>\r\n<p>With the man who is known as the ‘Father’ of Mindfulness, Jon Kabat-Zin, really bringing it to the forefront of people’s awareness, through his writing, speaking and teaching on the topic.</p>\r\n<p>But it is also a word that has been thrown around a lot without the proper use of it’s true power. We hear people say that they are being ‘mindful’ of their eating, their habits, their recycling, their health. But the true art of mindfulness doesn’t lie in the awareness of things, it lies in the kindness of that awareness.</p>\r\n<p>If we are being ‘mindful’ of how much we are watching TV, or what we are eating, but we are berating ourselves for having done so, or having done so poorly, then we are not going to feel calm and at ease.</p>\r\n<p>If we are being mindful of our breathing and bringing our awareness back into the present moment with our breath, but we are being unkind with ourselves when our mind has wondered for a moment or when we haven’t managed to do it that day – then we are again not going to feel the full benefits of connecting to the present and our body.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/Layer_5.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"><strong>When it comes to mindfulness kindness is key.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mindfulness is paying attention to the present moment with kind attention - whether that is an activity we are doing or a conversation we are having.

Visualisation Meditation</strong></h3>\r\n<p>One of my favourite visualisation meditations has to be the Mountain Meditation (15 minutes) by Andy Hobson on Insight Timer. This meditation compares the qualities of a mountain to your real life. We begin by sitting and starting to imagine a familiar mountain we know of in real life, films or imagination. The meditation takes us on a beautiful journey of becoming the mountain; the bottom of it being where your body meets the floor and the peak being the top of your head. In the same way a mountain remains dignified and grounded, even in the face of the harshest of conditions, this exercise teaches us to apply that same resilience to our own lives, allowing us to remain undeterred by our emotions, be it pain, sadness, joy, or elation.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-jonathan-borba-5489194.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>2. Buddhist Meditation&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Loving Kindness (14 mins) by Mark Joseph&nbsp;on Insight Timer is a great beginners meditation to cultivate loving kindness to ourselves, others and strangers, especially during the pandemic. It’s a really wonderful, energetic meditation and an all-round lovely experience. My reflections after this meditation are always that I am instantly uplifted and more compassionate&nbsp;throughout my day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-cottonbro-4273467_3_.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h3><strong>3. Pause &amp; Visualisation Meditation</strong></h3>\r\n<div>I became obsessed with doing Hope In Times Of Uncertainty (14 mins) by supermodel Gisele on Insight Timer. Not only was I intrigued to listen, but I found it really uplifting and a reminder that no matter what’s going on in the world around us right now, everyday we have the choice to operate out of love and hope over anxiety and hate. Our choices help shape our reality. This meditation is a great collaboration between the breath and accompanying visualisation, which in this case she uses a beautiful healing white light filling you with joy and optimism. It’s my go-to meditation.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-julia-volk-5273210.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></div>\r\n<h3><strong>4. Mantra Meditation&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<div>Mantra meditations are when a phrase is repeated in your head or out loud which would then be called chanting meditation. Some mantras are meant to be incredibly personal and are not meant to be shared with anyone else. In other cases, meditation teachers can give you a mantra to work with. It’s a great meditation to do for beginners if the mantra is simple like ‘Calm Calm, I am Calm’ or ‘Peace Peace\', \'I Am At Peace\' and ‘My Mind Is Still.’ Try Positive Energy Meditation (5 mins) by Gabrielle Bernstein on YouTube.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-flora-westbrook-1924867.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></div>\r\n<h3><strong>What hurdles may arise?</strong></h3>\r\n<div>If you find yourself getting tired, you can meditate with your eyes and open with a gentle soft gaze on the same spot. Sit up straight and try to focus on the top of your head. Also, make sure you\'ve cracked a window open. You don\'t want to be getting distracted by a lack of fresh air in the room. Stick to first thing in the morning if you know you become tired come the afternoon. I would recommend doing a more rigid guided meditation like some Squared Breathing which will keep you alert because you have to really focus. If you’re finding your practise boring, try to do a variety of mediations on Calm app, Insight Timer or Headspace. I like to mix it up and sometimes try it to music, or often I like to do a Contemplation Meditation which can work nicely walking in a park or a garden, taking in the nature and the detail of the colours and sounds. If continue to be bored perhaps ask yourself why you are you bored? Do you have somewhere to be? Do you think you’re wasting your time? It can be hard to go deeper and sit with ourselves but I promise you will soon see the benefits.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-fwstudio-129721.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\">When do I know if meditating works?</strong></h3>\r\n<div>This is completely different for everyone as meditation is so personal. Some meditators experience immediate calm and feel much more grounded after their practise. Other meditators will report how they felt the benefits much later in the day when they reacted to something in a certain way or didn’t find themselves getting lost in their story. There is much research in 2020 that gives us confidence that meditation can improve a variety of psychological areas. From stress, anxiety, addiction, depression to cognitive function, increased focus, empathy and even creativity. We are also seeing studies now that suggest meditation can reduce many modern health problems. Including high blood pressure, pain management, stress hormone levels and even cellular health. A study in 2011 by Hoezel and Lazer from the University of Harvard, showed that there are actual structural and functional changes to the brain across an 8 week span of meditation. These changes included an increase in grey matter in the brain, which is in the regions of the brain associated with muscle control, sensory perception, memory, emotions, speech, decision making and self-control.&nbsp; In 2010, Goldin and Gross from Stanford University showed a decreased brain activation of the amygdala which is the part of the brain responsible for triggering fear. Majority of studies show these changes to the human brain after 8 weeks of regular practice.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-drasa-3059514.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></h3>\r\n<h3><strong>I don’t seem to be able to let go of my thoughts - what am I&nbsp;doing wrong?</strong></h3>\r\n<div>Nothing! It is absolutely impossible to block out your thoughts. When a thought arises, and they will, like the clouds in the sky they come and they will go. No need to engage in them or judge them. Simply observe it and let it go and use your breath as your anchor or home base. When I get lost in a story I use&nbsp;my breath to come back or I say ’thinking thinking’ which takes me gently back to being in the practise. Also I have to point out, some people feel disappointed after their meditation like they didn’t do it right or felt really distracted and it was pointless. There is never a good or bad session. You may find the results weren’t instant but later in that week you may notice a difference.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h3><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-cottonbro-4268518.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></h3>\r\n<h3><strong>Lastly, how do I make this stick? You may have been trying but after a week or two you seem to lapse back into not practising.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<div>Remember, for meditation to work it is path and a journey that needs to be chipped away at every day. It’s called a practise for a reason. Like going to the gym and working out a muscle, this is a practise that is never completed and can always be worked on. Repetition creates a tendency which yields lasting effects. Consistency is key and having a regular and identified meditation space in your home is important. Begin with 5 minutes a day, don’t even think about a 15 minute meditation as it could set yourself up to fail. The key is to start small and build. We spend on a daily basis 4-5 hours on social media so I’m sure 5 minutes can be carved out of your day for this act of self-care.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Milla x</div>','2020-12-15 11:18:49','2021-01-05 12:47:01','2020-12-15 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/Image_from_iOS_52__1.jpg',NULL,16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'WZbV14VOKiUMMcosf4EgJNCxeAeSMhFN',0,NULL,'Leading health coach Milla Lascelles shares her top 4 guided meditations in the part 2 of her Meditation for beginners',NULL),(67,'Plant 75 - OTO CBD Mindful Christmas Cocktail',NULL,NULL,NULL,'plant-75-oto-cbd-mindful-christmas-cocktail',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>Enjoy this&nbsp;celebratory cocktail for the holiday season, inspired by the classic French 75.</p>\r\n<p>We teamed up with \'Healthy Hedonist\' Camille Vidal of La Maison Wellness to create this mindful CBD Cocktail to help people focus on the present and allow themselves to not be distracted or preoccupied with worries.

It’s fair to say, this has been a potentially explosive situation for our mental and physical health and with so much to be anxious about at the moment, the temptation to swallow one too many of the samples can be great indeed.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/Millie_KR3.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"><br>One thing we have been immensely happy to see over the last few months however, is the choice of genuinely delicious, alcohol alternatives - real grown up soft drinks that offer a compelling choice that isn’t booze. The desire and need to find more balance when it comes to what we consume has never been stronger, not just for us, but for our readers.</p>\r\n<p>The key discovery within the category this year has been CBD products, delicious drinks that do more than just taste good; they help us feel good too. As drinks professionals, when we choose not to drink alcohol, we want to reach for something that also feels like a treat but goes further than that. We want an interesting, complex flavour profile because that is what we are used to but we also want it totally guilt free, so low calorie, no sugar and no nasties, but with some other benefits and functions too.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/Millie_KR2.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>The OTO CBD seltzers fulfil all the above for us and then some. These all-natural, refreshing, sparkling waters showcase a wide range of unique, botanical extracts beyond the CBD. This means flavours that not only satisfy our cravings for complexity, but offer additional health benefits too, such as Kampot Pepper for its mood-improving chemicals and liquorice for its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.</p>\r\n<p>The best bit however, has to be the CBD. The optimum dose of 25mg per can, which is higher than most other brands. What we found pretty quickly was that it’s not necessarily about what it makes you feel; it’s about what you stop feeling. Anxiety and stress seem to melt away. It’s a delicious revelation - and the perfect antidote to 2020. Here’s to you all, wishing you a happy, calm and healthy 2021.</p>','2021-01-05 10:33:35','2021-01-07 13:46:55','2021-01-05 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/ritual_1_1_.jpg',NULL,16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'E9P2ENJGZxTy5j1H32Au7Lc8IEaX3SMn',0,NULL,'Following a turbulent year, our friends at The Three Drinkers give us their thoughts on the rise of grown up soft drinks and our CBD seltzers...',NULL),(71,'OTO\'s Ritual Skincare Trials earn rave reviews!',NULL,NULL,'OTO Ritual Skincare trial participants share why our new morning CBD skincare collection is unlike anything else on the market.','the-benefits-go-beyond-skin-deep-otos-ritual-skincare-trials-earn-rave-reviews',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>\"The benefits go beyond skin deep\" - </em>Paul M</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; font-family: montserratMedium;\"><strong>Our Ritual Skincare consumer trials have drawn to a close with resounding praise!</strong></p>\r\n<p>At OTO, we strive to make products that are both effective and enjoyable to use… and whilst we are confident in delivering this, you shouldn\'t just take our word for it.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s why we run extensive consumer trials on </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our products; so that we can continue to perfect and refine the optimum CBD experience for our customers.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the back end of 2020, we launched OTO’s Ritual Skincare Collection, which includes the <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/cbd-skincare/ritual-cbd-serum.html\">Ritual CBD Serum</a> and <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/ritual-cbd-day-cream.html\">Ritual CBD Day Cream</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>43</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> participants were given both products to try.

This recipe makes 12 x 40g pieces and serves four, with three falafels per serving.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">160g frozen spinach, leave to defrost overnight or for a few hours</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100g frozen peas, soak briefly in water to defrost&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">200g chickpeas, drained</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50g fresh parsley/coriander, or mixed if possible, roughly chopped, including stalks 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20g tahini</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1⁄2 lemon, juiced &amp; zested</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1 tsp cumin</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1⁄2 tsp smoked paprika</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 tsp baking powder</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40g chickpea flour</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sea salt and pepper, to taste </span></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Method</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preheat your oven to 180 C.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This recipe is to bake your falafel so as to reduce any unnecessary oil. Place everything except the chickpea flour in a food processor and blitz until combined, then add in the chickpea flour, tablespoon by tablespoon, until the mix starts coming together and is thick enough to shape with your hands. Taste the batter and add further seasoning if you wish.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To shape the falafels, it is best to wet your hands with cold water as this makes it much easier to handle the mix and roll it into 40g balls. Once you have made them, lay them evenly across a parchment lined baking tray, then bake for 20-25 minutes. Best served immediately.</span></p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Socca with Mushrooms &amp;</strong><br><strong>Caramelised Onions</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calories: 229</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serves: 2</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/ARTAH_recipe.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Socca is an incredibly versatile base for you to experiment with all sorts of flavour combinations. You can serve as a plain base with toppings, or just as easily incorporate a variety of vegetables, herbs and spices into the mix and bake as usual. This combination works particularly well incorporated into the batter or served on top. This recipe makes one large pancake which can serve two or split the batter for two individual servings.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1⁄2 cup chickpea flour</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1⁄2 cup potable water, warm</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1⁄2 tsp baking soda</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, divided 1⁄2 red onion, finely sliced</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5 mushrooms, finely sliced, variety of choice</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sea salt and pepper, to season&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optional:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fresh or dried herbs or your choice&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Method&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preheat your oven to 230 C. In a large mixing bowl, combine the chickpea flour, baking soda, salt and warm water, and any herbs of your choice and whisk away any lumps. Cover with a dishcloth and leave to sit for at least 15 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the batter is resting, sauté the sliced onion in a pan on a medium heat in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for around 5 minutes until softened and caramelised, then add in your sliced mushrooms, seasoning with salt and pepper. Leave both to colour in the pan for a further 5 minutes, then set aside.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your batter is ready add in the onion and mushrooms if you are mixing them in. If not, leave aside and place on top of the pancake once it is cooked.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drizzle 1 tbsp of olive oil in the pan and place it in the oven to heat up for a minute or so. Carefully remove the pan and pour in your batter, encouraging the mix to the sides with a spatula if needed.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leave to bake in the oven for 8 minutes or until crisp and golden at the edges. Best served immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Red Lentil Dhal&nbsp;</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calories: 273</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serves: 4&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/ARTAH_recipe2.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An ARTAH staple, dhal is an incredibly comforting dish full of plant-based protein and healing spices. The grated vegetables and coconut milk give it a great, full texture and beautiful vibrant colour. This recipe is on the milder side of spiciness but feel free to add some fresh chilli if you want a little more of a kick.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">250g or 11⁄2 cups of soaked split red lentils, soaked overnight</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 tbsp coconut oil&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 medium white onion, finely sliced</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1⁄2 tsp black/white pepper</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 tsp ground turmeric or 1⁄2 tsp of fresh grated turmeric&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 tsp fresh/ground ginger</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 tsp ground coriander</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 tsp ground cumin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 tsp garam masala/curry powder 2 tbsp tomato puree&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50g/small handful grated carrot 50g/small handful grated sweet potato 200ml potable water</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">400g or 2 cups chopped tomato (fresh or tinned)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">200ml coconut milk</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sea salt &amp; pepper, to season&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optional toppings:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 tsp chilli powder/ finely chopped fresh chilli coconut yoghurt</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sliced radishes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">toasted seeds&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Method&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to leave the lentils to soak in water overnight, to break down any indigestible starches.

Our Balance range is designed on the premise of being applied to skin that will be undisturbed and in a clean environment overnight. Meanwhile the ritual range is conceptualised on the basis that it would be applied to skin that would be constantly disturbed. Whether its harsh weather conditions, busy train carriages or UV light; our skin is affected by a mirage of external pollutants on a daily basis and as such, creating these products represented an entirely different logistical challenge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/image_3_.png&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The two main pillars of the range are the <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/cbd-skincare/ritual-cbd-serum.html\">Ritual CBD Serum</a> and <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/ritual-cbd-day-cream.html\">Ritual CBD Day Cream</a>, which when used together both fortify and protect your skin whilst actively repairing and nourishing it. When it came to conceiving the products that would make up the Ritual range, the serum was a no-brainer. CBD is effective at managing skin conditions that are caused by stress and anxiety – acne, eczema - conditions that flare up when you are feeling especially stressed and anxious, and the most effective way to absorb CBD transdermally is through an oil; CBD is what we call a ‘lipophilic’ molecule. This means that is dissolves in lipids, such as oils and fats as opposed to water.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A challenge in devising the recipe for the serum was therefore ensuring that we struck the right balance between being oily enough to heal the skin without being overly oily to the point where its use would be impractical and unenjoyable. One of the central motif’s at OTO is keeping user experience at the heart of our design process; these products need to not only be effective but <em>enjoyable</em> in equal measure. Personally, I have really dry skin so I can’t get enough of oil based products, but then there are people like Gemma who tend to stay away from oily products. In the end, we’ve made a product that works across many different skin types.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/serum-scene.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Pomegranate and Evening Primrose oil, both incredibly rich in antioxidants and polyphenols make up the base whilst Blue Tansy gives the Serum its unique colour and contains Sabiene, a component found to have anti-inflammatory properties. Just one pump gives you enough to apply to your whole face, and crucially also gives you exactly 20mg of CBD. Figuring out the right amount of CBD to consume, and when, has always been an impossible task, but with OTO you can be comfortable in the knowledge that&nbsp;the hard thinking has already been done for you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Not only is 20mg the perfect level of CBD to consume in this moment, but by combinining it with an array of hand-picked botanicals, rich in terpenes, we are ensuring the CBD is as potent as possible. Blending CBD with terpene-rich botanicals is a method that allows us to mimick what is commonly referred to as the \'entourage\' effect - whereby CBD is rendered more active by its synergistic interactions with other molecules. In other words, we have designed the serum to maximise the benefits CBD can bring, both therapeutically by being absorbed into the bloodstream, and dermatologically through its interactions with our skin cells - and they couldn\'t be easier to access.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/handbalm_range_1000x750.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">After forifiyng your face with the Serum, you\'re skin will be primed for the highly moisturising day cream, which is comprised of Rose Distilate, Baobab Oil and Rosemary Oil to name just a few of the ingredients. The inclusion of Rose Distilate is a great example of how functionality was at the core of our design process. By distilling rose petals in water, and then using a steam extraction method, you are able to retain its antioxidant properties and lovely fragrance whilst being left with a much lighter, thinner alternative to oil.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Many people have multiple steps to their skincare routine, and the last thing you want is to be leaving the house with your face glistening with product, or unable to apply make-up on top of your moisturiser, hence, creating these to products to be lightweight and easily absorbed was at the front of our minds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Together, we believe they represent the perfect barrier for our faces; one that both nourishes and protects simultaneously. As the name of the range suggests, these aren’t products to be used sporadically, but built into a morning routine; a morning <em>ritual</em>. And rituals aren’t just founded upon on necessity, but on the pleasure they bring. Whether it lie in the refreshing sensation of applying the day cream, the incredible smell and aesthetic of the serum, or just the feel of their sleek glass bottles, we believe we’ve crafted the ultimate, luxury morning CBD skincare experience... and I can\'t wait for you to enjoy it, again and again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">To learn more about the delight they brought our trialists, you can read the results of the trial <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/journal/post/the-benefits-go-beyond-skin-deep-otos-ritual-skincare-trials-earn-rave-reviews\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Rina x</p>','2021-01-12 10:17:11','2021-01-13 18:10:06','2021-01-12 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/image_2_.png','OTO Ritual Skincare Collection',15,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'uK7CJRasZQ0yIdKtfx3Nrsz602j7Xiyy',0,NULL,'OTO’s Head of Product Design, Rina Bhansali, reflects on bringing our Ritual Range to market in the midst of a national lockdown',NULL),(74,'Time to Talk with March Hollingbery',NULL,NULL,NULL,'time-to-talk-with-march-hollingbery',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>Today is Time to Talk Day, an opportunity to open up discussion around mental health.

That is certainly what my life has been, especially recently. Over the past year I have been locked away inside my home shielding from Covid-19 because annoyingly I have one lung so I am labelled as </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clinically extremely vulnerable</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> - a very over-dramatic term. It’s been a tough reality as a 23 year old, both emotionally and physically. Although, after a fair amount of moping around at the start of the pandemic, I forced myself to shift my mindset and create my own opportunities- all sneakily from the comfort of my living room sofa.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many of us, controlling&nbsp;my&nbsp;mental health this year has been an enormous challenge. Being separated from my two sisters for the most part of the year, being apart from all of my friends and to top it off - segregated from my longterm boyfriend too.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/Artboard_5.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Reunited with my sisters after 6 months)</span></em></p>\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Organic Mind Garden</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started to feel worthless because I was stuck at home with no clear direction of an exact career route that suited me.

In my opinion, that\'s what makes us individual human beings - the essence of a person. In nature, we are not all going to be the same, that\'s what makes life consistently unpredictable. This is the beauty of diversity. This is the importance of balance. This is why when you feel off kilter, it is </span><strong>essential</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to </span><strong>cushion</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> each other\'s mental filter by using your strengths to help overcome their weaknesses.

Nobody minds if you tell them how you feel, they can’t be annoyed for a feeling you have, all of our feelings are necessary as humans.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/March_6.png&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have never considered myself to be a disabled woman, but during this year I have realised that’s what society categorises me as - but I don’t want to succumb to that mindset.

We design accessories that can be bought as they are, but our main selling point is that we have made our atelier digital, allowing the customer to personalise our products to suit their style – everything from the colour of the stitching down to their initials.<strong> Our pieces are as unique as the person who buys them.</strong></span></em></p>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/_MG_4780_1_.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></span></em></p>\r\n<h1><strong>Why is the London Velvet journal so special?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The paper, the leather and the velvet were all specifically chosen to be in line with OTO’s brand pillar, Focus.

I’m a working single mum, and what with juggling my job and caring for my daughter alongside a lengthy house renovation, my ‘me’ time always took the form of a jog or bath and to be entirely honest I was happy if I could squeeze either into a busy day.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When the third lockdown hit, I found myself struggling to manage the impending sense of doom and stress at being stuck indoors and isolated again, and I found my mind returning to the words of journaling devotees, who’d told me that it acts as more than a daily check-in but also helps to detect unhealthy patterns in thoughts and behaviours, puts things in perspective, and joins the dots between thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and behaviours by bringing the analytical, rational left side of the brain into harmony with the creative right side, which is given freedom to dream and play.</p>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/LV_OTO-124-Edit.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></p>\r\n<p>I picked up a pen and my <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/oto-20-cbd-focus-roll-on-and-london-velvet-journal-pack.html\">London Velvet leather bound journal</a>&nbsp;(that comes in a set with <a href=\"https://otocbd.com/shop/oto-20-cbd-focus-roll-on-and-london-velvet-journal-pack.html\">OTO CBD Focus 20% Roll On</a>) and started doing it daily, and the results have been noticeable, with the best shift being feeling more positive and less anxious, which means I can find peace and balance during a tumultuous time.&nbsp;Generally, I sleep better, because my worries have reduced and I\'m more organised so when I\'m trying to nod off at night my mind isn\'t racing with a whole load of anxieties. The main thing is that journaling gives me a chance to properly process what is happening around me. Every day there seems to be another big change in my life, and this is my opportunity to write down my honest feelings and help me to regulate my emotions in time for the following day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-evgenia-basyrova-5028844.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Want to try it yourself? Here are some journaling tips I found helpful:</strong></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PICK YOUR TIME, AND TRY TO STICK TO IT.&nbsp;</strong>When you write<strong>&nbsp;</strong>may have more of an impact than you think. Try the morning to provoke, prioritise and synchronise the day ahead (this is also the time associated with more creative thinking, with the brain\'s inhibitory processes still weak), or at night to process the day\'s events, feelings and experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RELAX.&nbsp;</strong>It is important to feel relaxed before you start writing. If you struggle, practise a good relaxation technique like meditation or breathing exercises. I always take a bath before writing at bedtime. Try using OTO Focus Roll On on your wrists and temples to get you into the zone and find a peaceful area to express yourself.</p>\r\n<h2><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/IMG_5957_Facetune_03-02-2021-20-11-19.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></h2>\r\n<p><strong>BE YOUR OWN BFF.</strong>&nbsp;Asking yourself questions a&nbsp;friend&nbsp;might ask is a way of helping you to kindly get to know the unfiltered version of you, complete with the things you’re embarrassed about and the secrets and dreams you harbour without being limited by feeling something is unrealistic.&nbsp;By being vulnerable and acknowledging what we’re ashamed of, we let go of any guilt we’re holding on to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>USE IMAGERY</strong>&nbsp;I decorate my pages with drawings and scribbles and I also try to draw with my left hand (non-dominant) to switch things up. If you decide to draw, make sure you have enough time to get into the zone – a state of creative flow where time is non-existent.</p>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/LV_OTO-266-Edit.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>USE PROMPTS&nbsp;</strong>It’s up to you what you chose to write or draw but I find it helpful to use prompts to get me started. These can be helpful:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>How do I feel?</strong>&nbsp;I write down my thoughts and feelings as well as bodily sensations like any aches or pains. I draw symbols to symbolise how I feel.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What do I remember about my dream?&nbsp;</strong>If I have time after I wake up, I try to recall dreams, then write them down and draw the images I remember - this helps to boost memory.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Set an intention.&nbsp;</strong>I make sure I dedicate a part of my daily journaling to a particular intention, vision or goal.</li>\r\n<li><strong>What have I learned today?&nbsp;</strong>I always jot down one main lesson I learned that day - whether that’s asking for help on a particular project, new ideas that have popped up, or letting go of something that’s been weighing me down.</li>\r\n<li><strong>How am I feeling about relationships?</strong>&nbsp;Celebrating relationships and moments of compassion and understanding throughout the day is important, no matter how small.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Where could I use some support in life?&nbsp;</strong>Delegating is crucial to progress, so I&nbsp;take a moment to think what could be done by someone with that skill set to free up my time to work on something else.</li>\r\n</ul>','2021-02-12 11:21:12','2021-02-13 09:13:50','2021-02-12 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/IMG_5990_Facetune_03-02-2021-20-12-45.jpg',NULL,16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'ZEvWkPhCBtoRfLmAUuz9HXLb6w0B1sEg',0,NULL,'Wellbeing editor Lisa Oxenham explains how practising journaling daily has helped her to navigate this uncertain time with more confidence…',NULL),(78,'Choose to Challenge this International Women\'s Day',NULL,NULL,NULL,'celebrating-the-wonderful-women-of-oto-this-international-womens-day',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>This year\'s International Womens Day theme is Choose To Challenge, as rapidly growing challenger brand, the powerful women of OTO are very well-versed in this theme.&nbsp;Gemma Colao, Founder and Creative Director;&nbsp;Rina Bhasali, Head of Product Design and&nbsp;Helen Cain, Head of Spa share how they support, encourage and challenge themsleves and one another.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>Gemma</h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/gemma-colao-1080.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>What does International Women’s Day and this year’s theme choose to&nbsp;challenge mean to you?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\'For me, it\'s turning our challenges into our successes, embracing female leadership strengths - with empathy, compassion and caregiving as powerful assets.

We live in a world of always-on, which can be somewhat overwhelming – and undeniably distracting. The temptation to multi-task, procrastinate and not give things our full attention can not only have detrimental effects on our desired outcome, but also on the way we regard ourselves in relation to this. Lacking mental clarity can ultimately impact our mental wellbeing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And while you might think that remaining focused is only important when it comes to work, mental clarity is important in so many aspects of life. It can affect our sleep, exercise, relaxation, self care and daily practices.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, if you’re struggling to find your focus – here are my top five tips for gaining and maintaining a state of mental clarity.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-ekaterina-bolovtsova-7113346.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<h2><strong>Try out different methods to see what works for you</strong></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to focusing on specific tasks, there are an abundance of tools out there that can aid you in optimising productivity. But don’t just try <strong>time-blocking</strong> or <strong>eating the frog</strong> (sounds odd, but it’s a real thing!!) because you’ve seen other people doing it. The key is to try out different methods to see what works for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A personal favourite of mine is the Pomodoro method. Simply set a timer for 25 minutes and focus on one specific task for the whole duration of that time, have a five minute break, repeat. You then repeat this four times before having a longer 15 minute break, and continuing this process for as long as necessary. It’s a simple method, but for me – it’s been truly transformational! The idea behind it is to encourage sustained concentration and reduce mental fatigue.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I invite you to have a look into specific productivity methods and give a new one a go every day for the next week to see what works for you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-ekaterina-bolovtsova-7113299.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li>\r\n<h2><strong>Focus on one task at a time, when the time is right</strong></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Despite doing multiple things at once appearing to be a good way to get more done – trust me, it’s not. In trying to get more done simultaneously to increase efficiency, we often get less done overall and ultimately decrease efficiency...a lot. Either that, or we do a lot of things at a much lower quality than if we’d given each one the time and attention it deserves. Multitasking can increase stress, slow down your brain and overall make you less productive.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now this point doesn’t just apply to work. It can apply to anything. Be it speaking with loved ones, reading a book, practicing self care, journalling or exercising. If you’re like me, having a podcast in the background whilst cooking can be extremely therapeutic. However, trying to engage in a meaningful conversation with someone whilst simultaneously writing tomorrow’s to-do list doesn’t tend to go down well. So find your balance, and respect it. Know when your mind will benefit from focusing on one task at a time, and do so accordingly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-rachel-claire-4992603.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li>\r\n<h2><strong>Figure out your state of flow and tap into this</strong></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When does time pass fast for you?

Or perhaps it’s in the middle of the day just after a lunchtime yoga session where you feel as though you want to create something.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pay attention to the moments that empower you to do the things you want to do, with little desire to procrastinate, make excuses or divert your attention elsewhere. Tap into this feeling and take advantage of it! It is here to serve you.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-gabby-k-5384560.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li>\r\n<h2><strong>Listen to your body and respect its wishes</strong></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Remember that mental clarity cannot show up if you are not experiencing physical clarity too. Being in a state of lack can look like engaging in behaviours that distort your clarity such as consuming alcohol, but it can also look like not nourishing your body with the things that it needs to thrive; healthy foods, water, sleep, vitamins and minerals, sunlight, exercise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Enhance productivity by enhancing your physical state. Listen to what your body needs, and also what it doesn’t need. And also try and tune into when your body has had enough – when it’s tired and no longer wants to sit and write just one more chapter of your book, when it’s restless and craves getting up and moving not sitting and engaging in an hour-long meditation. It is not the right time to focus, all the time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-rfstudio-3820312.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n<li>\r\n<h2><strong>Set healthy boundaries with yourself and others</strong></h2>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With so much going on all of the time, it can be challenging to establish a time and place to focus. Setting healthy boundaries with yourself and others will enable you to do exactly this. And while this can look like physical boundaries such as telling loved ones not to enter your room when the door is closed, minimising distractions, or not being contactable by clients during certain hours, it can also look like establishing internal boundaries with yourself. This might be establishing a healthy level of accountability with yourself, knowing when it’s not the right time to engage in certain activities, or simply just respecting the desires of your mind and body.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Finding your focus and gaining and maintaining a state of mental clarity isn’t a one-size-fits all approach.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>But when you establish what works for you, everything else will naturally fall into place.</em></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/KB2.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>To learn more follow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/littlestepstohappiness/\"><em>Little Steps to Happiness</em></a></p>','2021-03-19 14:53:54','2021-03-23 09:25:06','2021-03-19 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/KB4.jpg',NULL,16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'zLgsXYODa50LN4IHokOPmNOxyl4y6gYB',0,NULL,'Katie Barnett, Identity, Life & Mindset Mentor, shares her top five tips for gaining and maintaing a state of mental clarity.',NULL),(80,'Find Your Balance As We Resurface',NULL,NULL,NULL,'finding-balance-as-we-resurface',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p>If, after a year of restrictions, you are feeling nervous to come out of lockdown, you’re not alone.

Try to focus on the positive things, our brains are programmed to focus and hold onto negative experiences and thoughts, by consistently bringing your attention back to what went well and what you are grateful for, you will begin to be inclined towards optimism and positivity.</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-alleksana-4113834.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Eat well &amp; stay hydrated</strong></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Respect your body by giving it immune boosting foods. Eating a balanced diet will give you the energy you need to re-enter the face pace of life. Simple hacks include eating more sweet root vegetables to curb those sugar cravings; switching from refined carbohydrates such as white bread to complex carbohydrates, such as buckwheat for longer lasting energy; cutting out caffeine after midday and replacing it with one of our sugar-free, all-natural CBD Botanical Seltzers.

We thrive on schedule and routine even if (like toddlers) we often rebel against it. If you don’t currently have a schedule, then start small. Set your alarm and wake up at the same time every day for a month. Yes, even on the weekends. Your body will get used to this schedule and soon you will begin to feel tired at the same time every evening too.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Set the mood&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We dread bedtime because it’s boring. But it doesn’t have to be. Your sleep ritual should feel rich, indulgent, decadent - like a reward to your mind and body for another day on this crazy planet. A little magic to melt away the day and prepare you for rest. That ritual will look different for everyone but, ideally, it should last for around 30 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Inhale relaxation, exhale stress&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-muhammad-lutfy-5660107.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bedroom should be a sanctuary for calm sleep. It should feel like a warm hug at the end of the day. Choose aromas and fabrics that indulge your senses. If lavender lights your fire, use it. If you like ylang ylang, douse the room with it. Whatever scents and products you choose, keep them strictly for bedtime. That way, when you light those candles or spritz that pillow spray, every evening, your brain knows that sleep is soon to follow.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Treat bedtime like a date&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Great days are built on the foundations of good nights. Dim the lights, spark a candle, and don’t stand yourself up. Commit to showing up for yourself every evening and watch your sleep and life flourish. If it’s easier, pretend your celebrity crush is waiting in your bed. You wouldn’t stand up Ryan Gosling, or Margot Robbie, would you?!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Enjoy yourself&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-daria-shevtsova-3794732.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bedtime ritual should be something that you look forward to. A chance to relax and unravel before drifting off to dreamland. If you’re struggling to design a bedtime ritual that works for you, reach out. We’re always here to help.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more head to sleep at <a href=\"http://www.sleepsiren.com\">Sleep Siren</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><br><br></p>','2021-04-29 08:29:27','2021-05-04 15:01:43','2021-04-29 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/maddi-bazzocco-519z6xuiMxc-unsplash.jpg',NULL,16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'jdzonOsOHs5nJGv15LfJx5NiuPdUjwnT',0,NULL,'The founder of Sleep Siren shares some top tips to start improving your sleep today. ',NULL),(86,'Adwoa Aboah \"love, love, love, loves\" our Hand Balm',NULL,NULL,NULL,'adwoa-aboah-loves-loves-loves-loves-our-hand-balm',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<style>\r\n.video-holder {\r\n    position: relative;\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    height: 0;\r\n    padding-bottom: 56.25%;\r\n}\r\n.video {\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 0;\r\n    left: 0;\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n.post-ftimg-hld{display:none}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-holder\">\r\n<iframe  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAHhEza32AE?start=551&end=571\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen class=\"video\"></iframe>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:4rem;margin-bottom:4rem\">Adwoa Aboah, British model, mental health advocate and founder of Gurls Talk, shares how much she \'absolutely love, love, love, loves\' our Ritual Hand Balm.

Before discovering OTO I had never imagined I would bring CBD to Spa because the earthy terpenes didn’t lend itself to the spa environment.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real benefit to the spa industry of infusing OTO CBD is our method of doing it; we infuse it with essential oils, lending itself to the aroma you would expect from a spa experience of the beautiful essential oils and not the earthy terpenes of hemp. That’s the real advantage of our spa oils. CBD isolate is completely odorless, it’s the terpenes you infuse it with. Each of our oils have been formulated to bring you into a moment. In order to amplify someone in our signature treatment; you have to think about the essential oils that would uplift and energise, Bitter Orange is rejuvenating and refreshing.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">CBD and Spa, the perfect pair</span></strong></h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Layering CBD throughout the treatment to give them the maximum amount means they will walk away with the best benefits and an opportunity to understand CBD and incorporate it into their homecare.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It really is a consultation as well as a treatment, analysing and prescribing what\'s best for the guest.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bringing the spa and wellness element together, we offer an experience that\'s not just going to affect you physically but also psychologically. If you think about the beauty industry this year it’s all about minimalism, tailoring back your products. There are receptors in our skin from the endocannabinoid system and therefore oils are an easy way of bringing CBD into your life. The experiences are a sensory experience that not only feels nice but treats you from within. It’s a win-win for both the therapists and the clientele; they both experience the benefits of sound therapy and CBD, with the ultimate aim of creating homeostasis, or balance, in the body.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>OTO Spa, designed with therapists in mind</strong></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I felt that if therapists were well educated, it would give them the tools and confidence, when explaining CBD and using CBD, to enhance the experience for the client. The CIBTAC accreditation is an international qualification in the OTO experiences. Not many suppliers do that, normally it’s an in-house certificate.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest problems for therapists is working back to back on massages. I wanted to create something that was user friendly from a therapist\'s perspective, concentrating on their welfare rather than just the supplier\'s welfare. That’s why the experiences are very tailored back, with simple underlying routines. The use of the bamboo, provides a tool to perform the deep tissue movement rather than over-use of the therapist\'s arms and wrists.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other big block in the industry is retail sales, a very low proportion of spas revenue comes from retail sales. We have brought elements of our retail range into the treatment; the Seltzer, the Roller-Ball and our Eye treatment. That’s a bonus for the therapist because they don’t need to work so hard to bring elements of retail into the treatment. All of that fits into the under 10% cost of sales.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><br><br><br><br></p>','2021-06-01 09:02:54','2021-06-01 09:09:25','2021-06-01 00:00:00',0,1,0,NULL,NULL,16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(90,'OTO\'s Luxury Fathers Day Gift Guide',NULL,NULL,NULL,'fathers-day-gift-guide',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<style>\r\n.blog-page .post-content a  {color:#000;}\r\n.post-content .post-description h2{text-transform:uppercase;margin-top:4rem}\r\n.blog-page .post-content h2 a {color:#000;}\r\n.buy{border-bottom: 1px solid #000 ;padding-bottom: 3px;font-weight:bold;color:black}\r\n.post-content .post-description .post-ftimg-hld {display:none}\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Struggling to find the perfect present to show your love and appreciation this Father\'s day?

Importantly though, CBD is not the single solution, instead it forms <em>part</em> of the solution. A healthy diet, mindfulness and your social surroundings all support better mental health too, and each element is intertwined. I manage my own mental health by combining all these factors together and taking a deep breath when I need it most.</p>\r\n<h2>How is mental health woven into the fabric of OTO?</h2>\r\n<p>OTO means \'sound\' in Japanese and relates to the space between sound and silence. At our&nbsp;core, OTO exists to help people find <em>that</em> space in their ever-busy, hectic and always-on lives. This is where our central brand pillars stem from - <em>Focus</em>, <em>Amplify</em>&nbsp;and <em>Balance</em>. First, we found that customers were looking for ways to <em>focus</em> amongst the clamour of their day to day lives. Second, people look to <em>amplify</em> the present despite constant distractions from emails, social media and news in your pocket. Finally, increasingly we see the growing need for <em>balance</em> in our naturally unbalanced lives. All these three elements embody OTO and resulted in us finding the solution in CBD.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-rafael-barros-1724375_1.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h2>Do you feel that there is pressure for men to conceal their mental health challenges?</h2>\r\n<p>For centuries, mental health was misunderstood and falsehoods were propagated, which has led to a fear in society. Instead, mental health should be treated no differently to any other ailment of the body, and needs constant care and attention. CBD has increasingly been used as a natural remedy to support better mental health, but openness and education on this issue is still the most important antidote to change people\'s perception around mental wellbeing.&nbsp;Education, awareness and understanding are the three most critical factors in reducing the stigma around mental health.</p>\r\n<h2>How can you maximise the effect of CBD on reducing stress?</h2>\r\n<p>There are various things one can do to help increase the efficacy of CBD. On one level there are innovative&nbsp;product&nbsp;development techniques that boost&nbsp;its bioavailability on the body. For example, at OTO, we use a wide range of Ayurvedic botanical extracts to create what\'s called an \'entourage effect\' and increase the rate that&nbsp;CBD is absorbed by the body. What\'s more, there are other more holistic suggestions, such as sound therapy, that help relax the body further. OTO is well known for hosting gong baths for our customers, because of the incredible benefits of combing CBD with sound.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/DSCF1817_2__1.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h2>What daily grooming routines help you to feel and look your best?</h2>\r\n<p>Nothing\'s more attractive than well-moisturised, clear and hydrated skin. Use a good morning face wash, followed by the OTO Day Cream, and it gives you great confidence to tackle life\'s daily stresses. Finish the day with a slow-absorbing face mask which can heal and soothe the skin while you sleep.&nbsp;CBD skincare is a fast-growing and fascinating space, as the CBD molecule binds with cannabinoid receptors in the skin and is absorbed transdermally. What\'s more, CBD actively regenerates skin cells, reduces inflammation and rebalances any skin conditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','2021-06-09 09:04:43','2021-06-11 10:19:51','2021-06-09 00:00:00',1,1,0,'magefan_blog/405039E9-F1C1-40FD-B711-FCA1095BD8BF.jpg',NULL,16,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'9o7OGLoB7VJsOjFcnkDyOJP2B7vfB4qp',0,NULL,'In honour of Men\'s Health week, we sat down with our Co-Founder and Global Sales Director, Tom Lorimer. Tom shares the importance of breaking the stigma around mental health, how he takes care of his mental health and the value of CBD for managing stress and anxiety.',NULL),(93,'Meaningful practices to enhance everyday',NULL,NULL,NULL,'rituals;-meaningful-practices-that-enhance-the-everyday.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rituals create consistency and certainty, allowing us to feel safe, grounded and settled.

Dress how you want to feel rather than how you feel; set yourself up for success. Trick yourself into being in a good mood! Hypnotherapist, Ryan Haddon says that your subconscious loves expectations; so tell yourself an affirmation about being ready and excited for the day ahead while you look in the mirror.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/pexels-cottonbro-4056535.jpg&quot;}}\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Movement</strong></h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a form of exercise that you genuinely enjoy and practice it daily.

Try to avoid blue light for an hour before bed, we recommend reading a book or listening to a sound bath instead.
